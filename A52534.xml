            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>BEFORE I come to ſpeak particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Matters relating to a Country Life, it will not be improper to glance a little upon this Subject as it offers it ſelf to our General Proſpect, which indeed is both
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47781:6"/>
pleaſant and profitable. And Firſt for its Pleaſure, what can be more ſuitable to a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well diſpos'd Mind, than to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the Improvements of Nature by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Methods and Arts of Culture: The ſame ſpot of Ground, which ſome Time ſince was nothing but Heath and Deſart, and under the Original Curſe of Thorns and Bryers, after a little Labour and Expence, ſeems reſtor'd to its Primitive Beauty in the State of Paradiſe. Curious Groves and Walks, fruitful Fields of Corn and Wine, with Flowry Meadows, and ſweet Paſtures, well ſtor'd with all ſorts of Cattle for Food and Uſe, together with all the Advantages and Delights of Water-Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Rivolets; as alſo with infinite Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Fruit-bearing Trees, of beautiful Flowers, of ſweet and fragrant Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the familiar and eaſie Productions of Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Ingenuity; all which, as they afford extream Delight to our Senſes, ſo muſt it needs be a raviſhing Pleaſure for the Contemplative to conſider. What an Infinite Variety of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, ſo beautiful and grateful to all our Senſes, and ſo ſovereign and uſeful for Health, may be produc'd out of a little portion of Earth well cultivated, and all this from little Seeds or Grains of ſmall worth in appearance: So that this kind of Employment may moſt properly be call'd <hi>a Recreation,</hi> not only from the Refreſhment it gives to the Mind, but from the <hi>Reſtauration of Nature,</hi> which may be lookt upon as a <hi>New Creation</hi> of things; when from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47781:6"/>
Nothing, or from ſomething next to Nothing, we become the Inſtruments of producing, or of reſtoring them in ſuch Perfection.</p>
               <p>And altho the Practice of Husbandry be a Buſineſs of ſome Toil and Care, of ſome Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and Expence, yet there is this in it to make all theſe things eaſie, <hi>viz.</hi> When a Man ſhall conſider the gradual Advancements of growing Nature, ſo that every Day repreſents Things under New Colours and Beauties. 'Tis pleaſant to ſee a Field of Corn ſhooting out of the Earth, which Pleaſure is ſoon loſt in a new and ſucceeding pleaſure of ſeeing the whole Surface of the Ground, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, perhaps of Winter, cover'd with the Blades of Green Corn, freſh and verdant as the Virgin Spring. This Pleaſure likewiſe, is again ſucceeded with others, ariſing ſtill from the New Appearances of Nature, which muſt needs be a growing Delight, foraſmuch as every Day leads us to a nearer Proſpect of Harveſt, which is the Crown of all our Labours.</p>
               <p>The like Content may be reap'd from all the other Employments of the Country, whether they relate to Planting, or to the Ordering of Paſturage. The Meadow which to Day is Green, two or three Days hence appears in another Livery, even that of Flowers, one Week White, anon Yellow, as ſoon Purple, or perhaps, in divers Colours at once, as if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had borrow'd its Beauties from Art and Fancy. Fruit-bearing Trees, for ſome time, are cover'd with ſpotleſs and ſweet-ſmell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47781:7"/>
Bloſſoms, ſuch as Perfume the Air, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh our Senſes with ſurpriſing Delights: Theſe Dropping off, the Fruit it ſelf begins to appear in its Infancy, which every day grows more Fair till it arrive to Maturity; and then ſerves further to gratifie our Senſes in yielding us Food of Delicacy; but more eminently, by affording us thoſe excellent Liquors, by which <hi>the heart of Man's made glad,</hi> and his Body ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd and nouriſh'd.</p>
               <p>Indeed, were we to take up always with any one Entertainment of Nature, we ſhould ſoon ſurfeit with it, as we ſee it happens daily to us in other Caſes, where the conſtant Fruition of one Thing ceaſes to affect us: But where there is ſuch an infinite Variety of Things (ſuch as are the Productions of the Earth) tendered to us ſucceſſively, and in their ſeveral Seaſons, this cannot but ſweeten the Mind with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Content: So that as the Toils and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are ſtill returning, in like manner are the ſweet fruits of them alſo: And even Toil and Labour it ſelf, has this Pleaſure in it, that it quickens Appetite, and contributes to Health and Strength of Body, where 'tis not in Exceſs, and accompanied with Diſorders. And when a Man attentively conſiders the Annual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Nature through all its Stages and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, it cannot but mind him of his own continual Changes, ſtill leading him forwards towards his End, which is, or ought to be a thing of more conſequence to him than all the other Pleaſures which he may juſtly hope to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47781:7"/>
reap from the ſeveral Bleſſings and Seaſons of the Year.</p>
               <p>Hence it was, that the Braveſt Men in the Firſt Ages of the World, betook themſelves generally to Husbandry, which (however ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and rude, as it appear'd) was found very advantageous and delightful; inſomuch that the Poets of Ancient and Modern Times, when they would deſcribe the true Felicity of Man, and give their Fancies the largeſt Flights of Freedom and Gayety, borrow all theſe Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions from the Paſtoral Life; and even they, who give us Characters of Great Generals and Princes in Heroick Strains, ſtill repreſent 'em by Metaphors of this Nature: Hence it was that they were called, <hi>Shepherds of the People,</hi> and the Scepter or Enſign of their Office was a <hi>Rod,</hi> or <hi>Staff,</hi> not a Sword. And truly, if we conſider the matter with a little Attention, we may readily obſerve that Men, and other Animals of the Herd, or ſuch as aſſociate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are to be govern'd much by the ſame Meaſures. King <hi>David,</hi> who rul'd his People certainly by good Maxims, and was the beſt and happieſt of any of that Nation, receiv'd doubtleſs, much Inſtruction from his Paſtoral Methods, of which we have many Inſtances through the whole Tenour of his <hi>Pſalms;</hi> but to proceed.</p>
               <p>The Great Eſteem which the Ancients had for Husbandry is further legible from hence, That they aſcrib'd Divine Honours to thoſe who were the <hi>Inventers</hi> and <hi>Promoters</hi> of it, ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47781:8"/>
as <hi>Bacchus, Ceres, Pan, Diana,</hi> &amp;c. Invocating them as the Tutelar Deities over theſe Affairs: Nor was there a God or Goddeſs to which they did not Conſecrate ſome Tree or Plant, thereby obliging them (as they thought) to attend more particularly to the Preſervation of them. But above all, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> being the greateſt Corn-Maſters in the World, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize the Benefits they receiv'd from <hi>Apis</hi> or <hi>Serapis,</hi> a great Prince, who preſerv'd them from Famine (which <hi>Apis</hi> is, by many, conjectur'd to have been the Patriarch <hi>Joſeph)</hi> ever wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd him as their Supreme Deity, under the Symbol or Repreſentation of an Ox or Calf, in conſideration, that 'twas to the Labour of that Creature we chiefly owe our Suſtenance and Life.</p>
               <p>And after the Gods; Thoſe Men were ever held in greateſt Honour and Veneration, who procur'd Peace and Plenty to the World, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by diſtributing their Liberality, or by protecting their Subjects from Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, thereby leaving them at Eaſe to follow their Country Employments; and ſuch an one was <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> under whoſe Reign the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> was ſhut, who likewiſe much delighted himſelf in Rural Avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the Converſation of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> the great Patron of Husbandry and Learned Men. The Figure of the World, encompaſſed with Olive-Branches, with the Inſcription of <hi>Pax Orbis Terrarum,</hi> was juſtly inſcrib'd by the Senate upon his Coins, for the Peace and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47781:8"/>
Plenty under the Influence of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Forms of Plenty, the Buſhels and Meaſures of Corn in the Ears, with the Inſcriptions of <hi>Annona</hi> or <hi>Congiarium,</hi> were the fulleſt Demonſtrations of a Prince's Greatneſs, and of the Peoples Gratitude: all which Teſtimonials, or Pompous Attributes, were ſtill meaſur'd, I ſay, from the Fruits of the Earth; ſo that the <hi>Romans</hi> never thought themſelves happier than under the Reigns of ſuch Emperors, who favour'd them this way: So that the Titles which are given to <hi>Adrian</hi> (under whoſe Reign the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſeem'd to be arriv'd to its fulleſt Beauty and Growth) were not dawbing Flatteries, but juſt acknowledgments of their Obligations to him, when in their Medals they Figur'd that Emperor with his Hand raiſing a penſive Woman from the Ground, having a Crown on her Head, and a Globe in her Lap, with the Inſcription of <hi>Reſtitutori Orbis Terrarum,</hi> thereby ſignifying, that he rais'd the World from the Earth, as I may ſay, with ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the Soleciſm. The like Benefits were acknowledg'd by ſeveral Provinces in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as appears by his Coins; for ſo it was, that this prudent Prince made it his buſineſs, more than any before or after him, to viſit the ſeveral Regions of the Empire, ſetting them in good Order, and leaving Marks of his Bounty through all the Stages of his Progreſs. The other many Noble Inſcriptions which we meet with every where in <hi>Roman</hi> Monuments,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47781:9"/>
ſuch as, <hi>Ob Cives Servator; Salus Generis Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani; Libertas Restituta Pacator Orbis,</hi> &amp;c. were the Fruitful Iſſues of Peace and Plenty, as Plenty was ever the Offspring of the well cultivated Earth.</p>
               <p>What Eſtimation the <hi>Jews</hi> had for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Life is very clear from Sacred Writings; Moſt or all of the Patriarchs or Princes of the Eaſt, of whom we read, were Herdſmen and Followers of Husbandry. <hi>Job</hi> had a large Stock of Cattle under his Care, and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom, David</hi>'s Son and Darling, made a Feaſt for his Sheep-ſhearers.</p>
               <p>As for Prophane Story; At ſuch Time as <hi>Rome</hi> was a Commonwealth, at which Time likewiſe it moſt flouriſhed with brave and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Men; 'Twas no rare thing for Plowmen to lead forth their Armies; Such an one was <hi>Atilius,</hi> who was Tilling his Ground with a Yoke of Oxen, and ſowing it himſelf, when the Senate ſent for him to be their General; thoſe Hands of his holding the Reins of a Triumphant Carr, which but a little before, held the Plough, to which he gladly return'd again, having proſperouſly finiſh'd what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook. No leſs Famous was <hi>Quintius Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnatus,</hi> who had the Dictatorſhip Conferr'd upon him as he was Plowing his Four Acres of Land near the <hi>Vatican,</hi> bare-headed, or cover'd rather with Swett and Duſt: Four Acres of Glebe, one would think but a ſmall Pittance for a <hi>Roman</hi> General or Emperour;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47781:9"/>
ſo conſiſtent then was Greatneſs of Vertue with the narrow Limits of Fortune.</p>
               <p>And even at ſuch Time as <hi>Rome</hi> ſeem'd to be <hi>en bon point,</hi> at the higheſt pitch of Luxury, we read of <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> a Senator, who was the moſt Learned Man amongſt all the <hi>Romans,</hi> and a Great Commander in the Civil Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and of ſome Figure likewiſe during the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> that he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd himſelf much from his Breed of Mares, and from his Flock of Sheep, which was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Hundred, as he himſelf tells us in the Book he has Publiſhed <hi>de Re Ruſtica,</hi> wherein he condeſcends to many Particulars relating to Husbandry and Good Houſwiſry, as alſo to the breeding and ordering of Fowl and Cattle. In the Second of which Books, being Dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Friend <hi>Niger Turranus,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, he tells us, how this Friend of his was wont to Trudge it a Foot, from Market to Market, to buy Beaſts.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, There cannot be a greater Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for the Honour of the Plough, than the Behaviour of <hi>Romulus,</hi> the Firſt Founder of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, as I may ſay, of that Vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as laying its Foundation in thoſe ſolid Maxims by which it grew to ſuch a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Greatneſs in after Ages: Amongſt which Fundamental Inſtitutions, this was one (if not the greateſt) <hi>viz.</hi> to Erect a College of Prieſts, under the Title of <hi>Sacerdotes Arrorum:</hi> Their Number was Twelve, of which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was one, condeſcending to be called the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47781:10"/>
Twelfth Brother of that Fraternity, being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Inſtalled thereunto by <hi>Laurentia Acca,</hi> his Foſter-Mother, who platting a Garland of the Ears of Corn, bound it on his Head with her White Fillet, which was lookt upon at that time to be the moſt Sacred Badge of Prieſthood, and was the Firſt Crown that we read of amongſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> And in ſo great Honour was it held in after Ages, that nothing but Death could put a Period to it, and was ever enjoyed, even in Times of Exile and Captivity.</p>
               <p>No Wonder then, if even Kings themſelves delighted to write of Husbandry, ſuch as <hi>Hiero, Philometor, Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Attalus.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Militant Perſons, <hi>Xenophon</hi> was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent this way; but much more famous was <hi>Mago,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal;</hi> which Works of his were held in that Eſteem, as to be Tranſlated into divers Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, an Epitome whereof, made <hi>Greek,</hi> was ſent to <hi>Dejotarus,</hi> as a Jewel of Ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Value; and particularly, it was lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>Romans,</hi> to be ſo precious, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the <hi>African</hi> Monuments of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this alone was thought worthy of the <hi>Romans</hi> Care, and to be preſerv'd, upon the Subverſion of <hi>Carthage,</hi> being Tranſlated like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe into the <hi>Roman</hi> Language, by the Care and Directions of <hi>M. Cato.</hi> Amongſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, whoſe Works are Extant, <hi>Ariſtotle, Pliny</hi> and <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> ſignaliz'd themſelves upon this Subject, as did alſo <hi>Theocritus, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiod</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47781:10"/>
and <hi>Virgil,</hi> amongſt the Ancient Poets, with infinite other Writers of modern Date.</p>
               <p>And ſuch an Influence truly had the Art and Practiſe of Husbandry upon the Minds of Men, that the moſt eminent of them in all Ages, whether for Military or Civil Employments, did ever betake themſelves, in ſome degree or other, to this Courſe of Life. Hence it was that every <hi>Roman</hi> of old had his <hi>Villa</hi> where to beſtow himſelf in time of Vacancy from Buſineſs, as they have at this Day in <hi>Italy,</hi> and elſewhere, belike thinking themſelves then moſt happy, when they take up with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of their Vineyards.</p>
               <p>As to the Profits ariſing from a Country Life, it is ſuperfluous to enlarge on that which is ſo obvious to all the World: And firſt, in reſpect of the General or Commonwealth. This is that great Vein by which the Blood is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through all Parts of the Body, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the very Blood it ſelf, ſince it is diſfus'd over the Whole, nor can any Part or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſubſiſt without it: It is the Foundation of Traffick and Commerce, foraſmuch as all the Manufactures and Commodities which we export or receive from Foreign Parts, are but the Productions of the Earth at the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand. Corn, Wine, Oil, Fruits, Cloth, Linen or Woollen, Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all of them the Off-ſpring of the Earth, cultivated by Art and Induſtry.</p>
               <p>And as the Husbandman is moſt neceſſary to the Publick in Times of Peace, ſo is he as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47781:11"/>
uſeful in Times of War, ſince all the Stores and Magazines, by which Garriſons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Field are ſuſtain'd, are deriv'd from his Labour and Providence. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription therefore which the Poet gave of old <hi>Italy,</hi> that it was <hi>Potens Armis atque <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bere Gleba,</hi> was well concerted; for <hi>Italy,</hi> as it was one of the moſt fruitful, ſo it was the moſt martial and victorious Country under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, giving Laws to all other Nations; ſo that were it under the Command of one Prince, it might poſſibly pretend to be once more the Miſtreſs of the World, as it was heretofore, when the Boundaries of its Empire were the Ocean, which it exceeded to in Greatneſs of Extent: Nor could it be poſſible for <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the other neighbouring Countries, to ſuſtain ſuch vaſt Armies, and to have been the Seat of War and Deſolation for ſo many Ages together, with ſuch immenſe Loſſes and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, were they not enabled thereunto by the invincible Induſtry of its Inhabitants, and by the Fertility of the Soil.</p>
               <p>In the next place, if we regard the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Intereſt of private Perſons, no leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious is it, that nothing can more advance it than Husbandry: The great Eſtates and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which many Men arrive to this way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain Proof of this Truth. If ſome miſcarry, 'tis no wonder, whether it be through their own ill courſe of Life, Ignorance or Negligence, or perhaps from ſome ſiniſter Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, from which no State or Condition can
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47781:11"/>
be exempted: But in the General, 'tis certain, that, conſidering the vaſt Numbers of Men who make Profeſſion of Husbandry, none make a ſurer Fortune than thoſe who follow it; there being ten Bankrupt Tradeſmen or Merchants for one Husbandman, Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being had, I ſay, to the Farms, which far exceed the Shops in Number.</p>
               <p>And as to our native Country in particular, it enjoys certainly many Advantages above any Country whatſoever: For in foreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſo it happens, that one Province a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds only with Corn, another is in Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Wine, a third is eminent for Herbage, a fourth for Boſcage; in which Caſe Men muſt be beholden to remoter Parts for Neceſſaries, which is a Buſineſs of great Expence, Trouble, and Delay; for Inſtance, <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> are great Corn-Countries, but have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wood, Wine, or Paſturage, all which Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, being from far, are very chargeable. <hi>Holland</hi> is famous for Butter and Cheeſe, but it muſt be oblig'd to foreign Countries for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all its other Commodities; whereas with us in <hi>England,</hi> there is rarely a Farm of Fifty Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> but has Meadow and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture-Ground belonging to it, together with ſome Wood or Coppice, as likewiſe with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Land for Corn, with Sheep-Paſture, as alſo with Trees for building for the Occaſions of Husbandry, for Fire, and in many Places for Fruit and rich Liquor, being yet farther bleſs'd with freſh and wholſome Water almoſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47781:12"/>
in every Ground, or with ſome little Rivolet or Brook running near it; ſo that a Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys all things almoſt within himſelf, of which he can ſtand in need, without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon others, or of being in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of want by any Difficulties in the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; tho' I muſt confeſs, that in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects foreign Countries have an Advantage over us, not only from the Sun and Temper of the Soil, (which generally requires leſs Manurement than with us,) but alſo from the Woods, which in hotter Countries are much more eaſie, being generally dry, ſmooth, and fit for Teams or Carriages at all Seaſons; or elſe they have artificial Canals, as in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> which indeed is a thing very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to a Farmer who keeps the Market; ſo that little Profit may be expected from a Farm, be the Ground never ſo good, which lies not near to a good Market-Town, or which wants the Conveniencies of good Roads, or of a Navigable River.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Saying, of <hi>Buona Terra, Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Gente,</hi> hath been by ſome applied to our Country, with reſpect, doubtleſs, to the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry of this Nation; for as for the ancient Gentry, probably there is not a more frank, a more generous, and a more open-hearted ſort of Men any where to be found, thoſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially who have not been infected with the Principles of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who (to give them ſome part of their due) are generally a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47781:12"/>
Brood of formal, cenſorious, and ſuperce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Hypocrites! Some of our true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry may want that flattering and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Gayety, ſo natural to our Neighbours, following the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Genius, which is plain, hoſpitable, and debonair, without much Ceremony and Diſſimulation; tho withal they are preſumptuous many times, and reſentive of Injuries, which really is much more commendable than modiſh Hypocriſie accompanied with Cringes and Grimace.</p>
               <p>But as for our Common People, many of them muſt be confeſs'd to be very rough and ſavage in their Diſpoſitions, being of level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Principles, and refractory to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſolent and tumultuous: What Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſoever then ſhall have the Misfortune to fall into the Neighbourhood of ſuch Boors, let him never think to win them by Civilities; it will be much more eaſie for him to teach a Hog to play upon the Bagpipes, than to ſoften ſuch <hi>Brutes</hi> by <hi>Courteſie;</hi> for they will preſently interpret a Man's Gentleneſs to be the Effect of a timorous and eaſie Nature, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make them bold and ſaucy. The beſt way therefore will be to bridle them, and to make them feel the Spur too, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to play their Tricks, and kick. The Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman was much to the purpoſe, That Three things ought always to be kept under, our Maſtiff-Dog, a Stone-Horſe, and a Clown: And really I think a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47781:13"/>
ſnarling, croſs-grain'd Clown to be the moſt unlucky Beaſt of the three. Such Men then are to be look'd upon as traſhy Weeds or Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, growing uſually upon Dunghills, which if touch'd gently will ſting, but being ſqueez'd hard will never hurt us.</p>
               <p>There is this Thing more to be recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to every Gentleman who affects a Country Life, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to embarras himſelf with too much Buſineſs; for the Affairs of the Country conſiſt much in Labour and Drudgery; ſo that he who has a great deal to manage, if he truſt to Servants will certainly be cheated or neglected by them; or if he hurries about it himſelf, he will be in a perpetual Toil, tho' of never ſo great Strength of Body; and to loſe all the Pleaſure of his Life in endleſs Pains and Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and having many hot Irons in the Fire to be work'd upon at once, ſome of them will cool and miſcarry upon his hands. 'Twas very well obſerv'd by the ingenious <hi>Bocalin,</hi> when all the Kingdoms and States preſented themſelves before <hi>Lorenzo Medici,</hi> to be weigh'd by his Balance, and when it came to the turn of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy to be put into the Scale, it ſtill prov'd lighter and lighter by the Addition of new Provinces; ſo that <hi>Spain,</hi> under <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, being infinitely aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Acceſs of <hi>Sicily, Naples, Milan,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countrys, Burgundy,</hi> &amp;c. was leſs weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and conſiderable than before. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, becauſe all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treaſure was exhauſted to maintain ſuch remote and foreign
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47781:13"/>
Dependencies, and ſerv'd but to feed the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of Viceroys and Governours; ſo that the main Body grew conſumptive and feeble by having its Nouriſhment diverted for the uſe of ſuch diſproportionable and foreign Members, with their excrementitious Superfluities. The ſame thing happens then inevitably in a private Gentleman's Eſtate, when it is too great for a ſingle Perſon to manage; ſo that there is no way for him, having ſufficient to employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about, but to farm out the Overplus to others. A numerous Herd of Servants, (tho' they are neceſſary Helps to one who has a great deal under hand, and ſerve to fill up the Meaſures and Figure of a Family, yet) do in reality impoveriſh the Houſe they belong to, being like Wenns, and the like Excreſcencies, which, tho' they ſeem to be a Part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to add to the Bulk, do in Truth ſuck the beſt Juice to themſelves, whilſt the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Parts languiſh and decay.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe who affects a Country Life ought to be a Perſon of ſubdu'd Paſſions; for where there is a continual Hope, there will be the ſame, or poſſibly a greater degree of Fear likewiſe; and the various Accidents to which our Labours and the Fruits of the Earth are hourly expos'd, cannot but leave a Man frequently under the Impreſſion of theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Seed which the Husbandman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to caſt into the Earth may be good, and the Soil duly prepar'd, and yet the unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Weather, at the time of ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47781:14"/>
may fill him with Diſtruſt, and fruſtrate his Hope. The like Fruſtration alſo may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen afterwards from extreme Froſts and Winds, from immoderate Rains and exceſſive Drouth: And when he is upon the Point of reaping the Fruit of his Labour, all may be loſt by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of the Weather. Or ſuppoſe we farther, that he hath converted all the Fruits of his Labour into Money, this likewiſe is ſubject to many Dangers; or if he be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to lay it out for the Procurement of other Bleſſings, theſe may become a Snare to him, and he may ſurfeit himſelf by Plenty, and be cut off in the midſt of his Enjoyments. How many Miſchiefs are there to which Fruit-bearing Trees are obnoxious! And when all thereunto relating ſhall fall out according to our Deſires, how eaſie is it for a Man to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd by too much delight in drinking of the juicy Bleſſing, falling either into a Diſeaſe, or into Habits of Intemperance, to the final Conſumption of his Eſtate, Parts and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: So that the true way for a Man to be happy amidſt his Travels and Labours, is not to be over-anxious about ſuch Comforts, but to be moderate in the Fruition of them; and by this means he will ſecure himſelf from Diſappointments, and have his Appetite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was quick to reliſh what is grateful, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temperate and abſtemious. And thus may a Man rejoice innocently in all his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and be prepar'd for a more perfect Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of what is ſolid and unalterable, by his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47781:14"/>
conſtant dependance upon Providence, and by making God's Bleſſings to be the daily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Thoughts.</p>
               <p>If there were a Kalendar, or Diary, kept of Weather, <hi>viz.</hi> what Rains or Winds, what ſeverities of Heat and Cold; what Plenty or Dearth, what Viciſſitudes or Accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen every Year, it would be a moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Work doubtleſs; and of far more uſe than all the Prognoſtications of cautious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers; for it happens very frequently, that upon the ſame Concurrence of Cauſes and Circumſtances, we meet with the ſame Effects. This Method was obſerv'd ever by the beſt Artiſts in Husbandry. And amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, as we may read in <hi>Virgil,</hi> they had a conſtant regard to the Heavens, as to all the Seaſons and Productions of Nature.</p>
               <p>And as there ought to be a Diary or Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for Seaſons, ſo likewiſe for the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which come from Foreign Parts; and to this End and Purpoſe, 'twould be a Diverſion well worthy the Ingenuity of many Young Gentlemen who travel, to be curious in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what Fruits every Soil does yield, as alſo the Nature and Complexion of the Soil, the Temper of the Climate, the Rules of their Husbandry, the Tackle and Inſtruments they make uſe of, as alſo their Methods of Manure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with what Returns they make of their Labours. As for Curioſities of Plants, Fruit-Trees, Flowers, and other Rarities of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, brought over from Foreign Countries,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47781:15"/>
we have certainly as great a Collection as any Nation under Heaven, there being none to be found which is ſo univerſally ſtor'd with all Proviſions of this kind as is <hi>England,</hi> and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſome parts of the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> which Benefit we have from the great Trade we drive in all Parts of the World; ſo that, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is rare, is brought over, and naturaliz'd amongſt us, being made free of our Soil.</p>
               <p>The like Improvements might be made, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, in matters relating to Husbandry and Planting, which would be of equal Pleaſure with the Entertainments of a Garden, and of infinite more Profit, beyond all Diſpute; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we make choice of ſuch Experiments and Obſervations as are already made by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſons of this latter Age, in which, this ſort of Natural Hiſtory ſeems to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its utmoſt Perfection; Out of all which Writings of our Modern Times, a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Syſtem or Body of Husbandry might be compiled, than which nothing could be more reputable to the Undertaker, nor more beneficial to the whole Kingdom: Not that I think it Expedient that all Foreign Growths ſhould be encourag'd, for this in many caſes, may be detrimental, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, eſpecially when the Introduction of ſome things, ſhall diſcredit and diſcourage the Growth of others: only then 'twill be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the Publick, when 'tis of ſuch Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as are imported on us from abroad; for by this means we ſhall never be at any ſtraits in time of War, for what we want, and our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47781:15"/>
will be leſs in the courſe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Traffick. I ſhall inſtance only in Three Things, of which</p>
               <p>The Firſt is, The Planting of Hemp and Flax. 'Tis known to all, what Profit is made of the latter in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>France;</hi> the Growth of Flax being eſteem'd equal to that of the richeſt Wines in <hi>Italy,</hi> as being cultivated in the ſame rich Soil, ſuch as that in the State of <hi>Milan, Parma, Modena, &amp;c.</hi> than which there cannot be a better upon Earth: And when I conſider, that the Flax Trade, and the Thread and Cloth made of it being a ſedentary kind of Employment, clean and fit for Ladies, no doubt many nice Fingers which refuſe to handle greaſie Wooll, might eaſily be invited hereunto: And that this was the moſt honourable Vocation in which the Nobleſt Matrons and Virgins of Ancient Times were employed, is abundantly evident from Ancient Records, the Invention thereof being of Divine Extraction, and aſcrib'd to <hi>Minerva;</hi> the like Eſteem it has ever preſerv'd to its ſelf through all after Ages, inſomuch that all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, even of Royal Degree and Birth, were, and are ſtill, ſtiled <hi>Spinsters;</hi> becauſe this was the Buſineſs they were to profeſs and practice: No wonder then if amongſt the Familiars of the Nuptial Waggon amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Wheel and Diſtaff was ever the chiefeſt, and moſt conſpicuous: And truly, could the Profeſſion of Spinning be ſeparated from the Maiden State of the greateſt Princeſſes, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47781:16"/>
Law would meet with an unlucky Rub, or perhaps a Baffle, when it bars the Diſtaff from Succeſſion to the Crown, by telling us that it cannot fall <hi>en quenouille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Advantage to the Kingdom ariſing from the Linnen Manufactures, would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, eſpecially if young Children were inur'd hereunto from their Childhood, for by that means their Fingers being then young and pliable, would get ſuch an Habit of working, as Age it ſelf could hardly wear away. A Scheme of this Nature I have met with in a Book publiſhed by Captain <hi>Yarrington</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire,</hi> a very knowing Projector, from the Obſervations he made of the vaſt Advantages they found in <hi>Holland</hi> by theſe and ſuch like Arts well worthy our Imitation; ſuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being there bred up in Working-Houſes or Colledges, under the Guard of honeſt, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and experienced Miſtreſſes or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers.</p>
               <p>Another thing of which it might be wiſh'd there were a Tryal made, is that of the Silk Manufacture, by planting of Mulberries, which doubtleſs might be made to proſper in this our Iſland. This likewiſe would be a very ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Employment or Recreation rather, for the more delicate of the other Sex, who are ſo much taken with the Gawderies of Butterflies: From whence alſo they may learn this Moral Lecture, That as the greateſt Ornaments and Luſtre of their Bodies are the Spoils of Worms,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47781:16"/>
ſo the greateſt Food for Worms will be upon the Spoils of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>The Third Thing which I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to be encourag'd, is the Planting of Wallnut-Trees, not for the Benefit of the Fruit to eat, which is inconſiderable; but for the Profit which might be made of the Oil, which tho of little Uſe with us, would be very well worth the Exportation; it being amongſt the poorer ſort beyond-Sea, ſome part of their Food, and moſt ſerviceable to the Great Ones too, in the Uſe they make of it, to be Fuel for their Lamps, eſpecially in their Churches, and almoſt in all Private Houſes. There is no Tree whatſoever growing in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soil, whoſe Timber is ſo uſeful for Curious Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; ſo that every Limb or Branch of a Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-Tree which will but carry Three Inches Square, is ſerviceable and of value: Nor do I find that theſe Trees are of any Difficulty to be rais'd as to the choice of Ground, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſo much hazard as Oaks, and other Trees, upon Extremities of Weather. All that can diſcourage the Tryal of them is, the long Time we muſt wait for the Maturity of them, which exceeds the common limits of an Age; but ſince there is no more Care about them when they once begin to grow, than about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common Trees which grow wild and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, it ſeems too great an Argument of a mean Spirit in a Man, to meaſure all his Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the returns of Profit which he may expect in his own Life-time, without regard to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47781:17"/>
the future Advantages which his Heirs and After-Ages may reap from his Induſtry. Tho in what I am now ſpeaking of, there is a great Pleaſure and Satisfaction in ſeeing the gradual Advances of Nature, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Profit to be expected too, by the Fruits they yield, which will be ſtill greater the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they grow.</p>
               <p>'Tis much to be wiſh'd likewiſe, That the State would afford ſome Encouragement to Husbandry, more than what we find at preſent, by exempting it, or at leaſt by eaſing it, as to the Publick Burthens, eſpecially for ſome Years, upon any New Undertaking, which ſhall be judg'd profitable to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: For by this Means Men would venture upon Projection. 'Tis very well obſerv'd by a moſt Ingenious and Learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in his Remarks upon one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, moſt Ancient, and moſt poliſh'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Earth, when he tells us, <q>[That Agriculture is encouraged by ſo many ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Priviledges from the Crown, and the Common Laws and Cuſtoms of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that whatever Wars happen, the Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Ground are untouch'd, as if they were Sacred, like the Prieſts in other Places, ſo as no Country in the World was ever known to be ſo well cultivated, as the whole Kingdom of <hi>China.</hi>]</q> Whereas with us, and other neighbouring Countries, 'tis the poor Husbandman who muſt ſupport in a manner, the whole Expence of a War, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47781:17"/>
undergo greater Burthens and Drudgery than the Beaſts which Till the Ground.</p>
               <p>In fine, What I have written upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is not grounded upon the Reports and Methods of other Authors, but upon my own <hi>Obſervations,</hi> towards which I have had ſome ſmall Advantage by my long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a Private and Country Life, which <hi>Obſervations</hi> I ſhall adventure to deliver more particularly in the following <hi>Chapters.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Tillage.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Art and Practice then of <hi>Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry</hi> is reducible to theſe Three Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heads, <hi>viz. Tillage, Paſturage,</hi> and <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> On each of which I ſhall be brief, in regard many write daily upon this Subject, more copiouſly ſometimes than ſolidly; their Volumes generally ſwelling with trivial Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and large Digreſſions; whereas the Reaſon of things is more eaſily comprehended when contracted into a leſſer Room, and freed from tedious Repetitions and Exemplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin firſt with <hi>Tillage,</hi> which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the open and common Fields, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt Incloſures; and altho' Incloſures, where every Man's Property is ſecur'd by Fences, may ſeem much more eligible, yet ſo it is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fields are held generally in greater Eſteem and Value, and that for theſe Reaſons, as, 1ſt. In common Fields Men are delivered from the continual Vexation and Expence ef ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and repairing of Hedges, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Injuries of Cattle breaking in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one anothers Ground: For ſuch common Fields bordering upon Paſturage, or other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47781:18"/>
it lies upon others to ſecure the Mounds. Beſides, there are Haywards appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on purpoſe to make their Rounds, and to ſee all things ſafe. 2dly, Common Fields have a great Advantage above Incloſures, from Sheep; for when they lie fallow, by being wide, the Sheep are forc'd to nip the young Weeds as faſt as they peep out of the Ground, and there leave their Dung; by which means they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert what is moſt hurtful to what is moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for Corn; whereas in little Incloſures they will be ſtill brouſing upon the Hedges, where likewiſe they will be continually nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſling to avoid the Sun and Cold, ſo that they deſtroy the Fences, and leave their Dung in Places which make no return, whilſt the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is poiſon'd with over-grown Weeds and Traſh; and here indeed lies the true Profit of Sheep, for where they are kept in leſſer Cloſes, the Owner will be in perpetual danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by them, and the Sheep themſelves will be in danger of tearing their Fleeces, and of leaving their Wool amongſt the Thorns and Buſhes. 3dly, Common Fields are more open to the Sun, and more free from Birds likewiſe, which lying in the Trees and Hedges, will be continually preying upon the Corn; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in little Incloſures, Corn never ripens ſo kindly, being under the Shade and Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of Trees; the Roots likewiſe of the Trees ſpreading to ſome diſtance from the Hedges, do rob the Earth of what ſhould nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the Grain, as the Birds likewiſe will not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47781:19"/>
be wanting to play their part from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Hedges, as ſoon as the Corn begins to ripen in the Ear.</p>
               <p>Incloſures nevertheleſs have this Advantage, (which perhaps is peculiar to <hi>Hereford, Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>Gloceſterſhire,)</hi> that in the Hedges Fruit-Trees may be planted, the Profit whereof in ſome Years equals half the Rent of the Ground: But this, I ſay, is local, or a Profit only in ſuch Countries where Fruit-Trees are thrifty and flouriſhing. And as for other Trees, as Oaks, Elms, Aſh, and the like, which grow commonly in Hedges, 'tis well if the Lop and Crop of them will ſerve for Fewel, and the old Trees, and other Wood ariſing from thence, defray the Charge of Ditching, and of repairing the Mounds and Hedges from time to time. This Advantage notwithſtanding is hardly worth taking notice of, it being much more profitable to have ſuch Hedges as ſhall never need repair, than to have Trees growing in them which from time to time may ſupply the Husbandman with Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el: For 'tis certain that great Trees rob the Quick of its Nouriſhment, and the Treſpaſs which the Husbandman receives by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual decay of ſuch Hedges near ſuch Trees, and the Expence he muſt be contiually at in making them good, makes ſuch Fences very chargeable and expenſive, whereas a clean quick-ſet Hedge will never need repair.</p>
               <p>There is farther Advantage likewiſe from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, in that a Man receives no Treſpaſs or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47781:19"/>
Damage from a Neighbour's turning upon his Grounds; for ſo it is, that in Common-Fields the firſt Plower always receives a conſiderable Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, eſpecially upon his head Lands, which abutt upon another's Lands; for he that ſows laſt turns his Cattle backward and forward on it, to the great Damage and Deſtruction of what was firſt ſown. Beſides, the continual Treſpaſs of going over one anothers Grounds and Corn, both at Sowing and at Harveſt-time, is very prejudicial to the Crop. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, Common Fields are much to be preferr'd before Incloſures, for the Reaſons before-mention'd.</p>
               <p>Fallowing of Ground every third or every fourth Year, is excellent good Husbandry: For they who plow upon the Bruſh, (as they call it in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,)</hi> that is to ſay, every Year tilling and ſowing the Ground, without Intermiſſion, will certainly be plagu'd with Weeds enough; for 'tis the Fallow, or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Earth to the Sun, which kills the Weeds at the Root, and makes the Earth more freeable and fine, and gives the Dung or Compoſt time to mix and incorporate with the Soil; whereas the other Method, beſides the Damage of Weeds, robs the Ground of all its Virtue by continual Crops, nor can the Dung have time to digeſt and mix with the Earth before the Grain be ſown. This piece of Husbandry was much in uſe amongſt the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> as appears by <hi>Virgil, Georg.</hi> I.</p>

               <p>In the Interpretation of which Place Authors are at ſome Conteſt. The Explication of <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſeems moſt rational, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ground is fitteſt for a Crop of Bread-Corn which has been four times plowed; of which the firſt plowing muſt be in the Winter, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in the Spring, the third in the Summer, and the laſt in Autumn, or immediately before the Seaſon of ſowing; ſo that the firſt and laſt Plowings, according to his Interpretation, muſt have alluſion to <hi>bis frigora;</hi> the other two Plowings are poetically recommended by the Vernal and Aeſtival Suns. The Reaſon of the Summer-Fallow is taught us by the ſame Poet a little after.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Becauſe the parching Sun burns the fibrous and ſtringy Roots of the Herbs or Weeds, which otherwiſe would choak the Grain.</p>
               <p>Lime and burning of Ground is kinder for Corn than Dung; for Dung, beſides that it requires ſome Digeſtion or Maturation, is ſubject to breed Weeds, by reaſon of the Weeds and their Seeds which lie in the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the Shovelings of Folds is the worſt thing imaginable that can be thrown upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47781:20"/>
Tillage; for it conſiſts chiefly of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowings of Corn, with all manner of Traſh whatſoever; and tho' the Chaff or Litter be perfectly rotted and turn'd to Earth, yet it ſhall ſtill flouriſh with Weeds beyond any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Soil or Compoſt whatſoever; but for Paſturage ſuch ſort of Management is very kind.</p>
               <p>Pigeons-Dung is the hotteſt of any; one Load and a half of it being thinly ſtrew'd or ſown, is ſufficient for an Acre. Next, Sheeps-Dung is an excellent Manurement, and of this about four Load to an Acre; of Horſe-Dung, eight Load upon an Acre is good dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and of Beaſts or Cow-Dung, ten or twelve Load; and of good mellow Earth, as the Mud, or cleanſing of Pools, Ditches, and the like, after two or three Years ſweetening, we ought to beſtow twenty Load at leaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Acre. We are to note likewiſe, that the freſher the Dung, the better 'tis for Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration; ſo that one Load of Dung, a little ripened or ſettled in a heap, is as good as two Load of that which has lain two or three Years mellowing; foraſmuch as two Load of freſh Dung, after it has lain for ſome time rotting, will not make one Load. Beſides, the ſaline or ſulphureous parts of the Dung (in which its vegetative Virtue does principally conſiſt) by lying long in the heap, are waſted by continual heat and rottening, and after ſome time will prove no better than rank Mould, or Earth; whereas that which is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47781:21"/>
new is fat and unctious, and full of heat and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>This which I have ſaid holds true in the Manurement of Ground for Corn; but for Garden-Ground, that Dung which is oldeſt and moſt rotten is the beſt, becauſe it may be made fine and ſifted, and by this means be fit for all Seed-Plots, Boxes, Flowers, and the like. But in all theſe Caſes no difinitive Rule can be given; foraſmuch as the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Temper or Diſpoſition of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeveral Places very different, more or leſs help muſt be us'd, and generally ſpeaking, an Acre of Arable dreſs'd as before-mention'd, will yield three Crops. But of all Manure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I hold Lime to be the beſt: Four Load to a moderate Acre is a good dreſſing; it kills the Weeds, corrects the Coldneſs of the Soil, and cheriſhes the Grain; ſo that the Ground which is dreſs'd with it will be the better for Several Years after. 'Tis likewiſe wonderful good for cold weeping Paſture.</p>
               <p>In former Ages they manur'd their Land much with Marle, which is a hot kind of Earth, and ſlakes ſomething like Lime: And 'tis certain that they us'd vaſt Quantities of it, as appears by the great Pits we find in all Places where ſuch Husbandry was in uſe, ſome of which Pits will contain ten or twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Loads; but this ſort of Husbandry, ſince the uſe of Lime has been in credit, is much neglected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47781:21"/>
Burning of Land is excellent good for Corn, for by this means the Weeds are kill'd, and the Strings or Fibres of the Weeds or Graſs being turn'd into Aſhes enrich the Ground mightily, by reaſon of the ſaline or nitrous Particles with which the Aſhes do abound. Upon which account it is, that ſuch Marſhes as lie near the Sea-Coaſt, and are waſh'd with the briny Element, are extraordinary luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and feed Cattle beyond any other. Shells and traſhy Weeds, of which we find great quantities on the Sea-ſhore, are wonderful Helps to Tillage; ſo that a barren piece of Ground, not worth Four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre, will yield eight or nine Crops ſucceſſively, as I have been credibly inform'd; the Reaſon is from the great quantities of Salt which ſuch Traſh does abound with; and for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon 'tis, I ſay, that <hi>Rumny</hi> Marſh and the Marſhes of <hi>Holland</hi> feed the beſt of any Ground in the World. Hence it is that the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> have ſuch a large Breed of Men, Horſes, and other Beaſts, as are not elſewhere to be found: And for the ſame Reaſon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 'tis that the Animals which are ingender'd in the Sea are far more numerous and greater in bulk than thoſe of the Earth; and the young Fry or Spawn of Fiſh belonging to the River, ſuch I mean as reliſh the Salt-Water, as Salmon, Lamprys, and the like, tho' ſmall and little when they leave the freſh Streams, will, upon their Return from the Salt-Water, in a very ſhort time acquire an extraordinary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47781:22"/>
Growth. Fiſh which are ſo teſtacious, as Crabs, Lobſters, Oiſters, and the like, are much more nouriſhing than other Fiſh, by reaſon of that volatile Salt with which they do abound</p>
               <p>What we read of old, of ſowing Cities with Salt, when they were to be eras'd and condemn'd to utter Deſolation, ſeems much to confirm this Opinion; for by that means the Soil was made fit for Paſturage, and for the Service of Beaſts, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be unfurniſh'd with Men; tho' I much doubt whether our common Salt, if ſown upon the Earth, would produce any great effect, having receiv'd poſſibly ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration from the Fire. I am more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therefore to believe, that by ſowing ſuch Places with Salt was no more but to ſow or ſcatter the Aſhes on them, ariſing from the Ruines, which generally was by burning; which Aſhes, by reaſon of the copious Salts with which they did abound, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by a kind of Figure, called Salts, and ſuch as ſerv'd to render the Soil uſeful only for the Nouriſhment of Beaſts, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerv'd. Why ſuch Salts ſhould be ſo fruitful ſeems to proceed from their penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Nature, by which they ſeem to open firſt, and then to purge the Bodies which do imbibe them from their cold, crude Humours, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them likewiſe, and afterwards rendering them more uniform and compact.</p>

The way of burning Land, is by gathering the Turfs into little Heaps, in the hollow whereof a little Buſh or Faggot of dry Wood being laid; after the Turf has been well dry'd and parch'd by the Sun, they ſet the Hillock on Fire, and afterwards ſcatter the parch'd Turf and Aſhes upon the Surface. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of improving the Ground by burning, was much in practice amongſt the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> Their way was to burn the Stubble which remain'd after Harveſt, as it was left ſtanding on the Ground, and this ſerv'd to prepare it for another Crop, as we many Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from <hi>Virgil, Geor</hi> 1.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The ſame Method likewiſe of burning the Stubble upon the Ground, is much us'd at this day in the Campaine of <hi>Rome,</hi> at which time the Air is very ſcorching and unhealthy, the Heat of the Climate being very much increas'd by ſuch general Burnings, attended with ſo much Smoak. In a word, this way of Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47781:23"/>
is all the help they have in a manner, in the hotter Countries; where the paucity of Cattle would not afford Soil to dreſs the Tenth Part of their Tillage; ſo that the heat of the Climate, with a little help from their ſtubble Trees, does do that which we of the colder Regions are forced to purchaſe with four times more Charge and Trouble.</p>
               <p>Raggs cut or chopt to pieces, are us'd in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places as a great help to Tillage; and 'tis ſtrange to ſee what a Crop of Corn ſome barren flinty Ground ſhall yield after ſuch a Manure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In dreſſing of Ground with Dung, 'tis good to let it lie a little in the Heaps, and digeſt the rawneſs of it in the Sun: For turn'd in freſh, 'tis not ſo good, and to let it ly too long, the fat and oily parts will be too much exhal'd.</p>
               <p>Many Husbandmen, eſpecially in open com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fields, where they cannot fallow their Land, unleſs all agree together, ſow Vetches, which ſerve their Horſes all the Summer, by hitching them on the Land, where they will be ſure to eat it bear, and leave good ſtore of Dung in the place: This Method is lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be as good almoſt as a Fallow with dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is perform'd with no Charge nor Trouble.</p>
               <p>Many likewiſe, before they ſow their Grain, eſpecially Wheat, ſteep it in Urine or Brine, that it may imbibe the Salt, and then they flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it with Lime: This they do, not only to ſtrengthen and cheriſh the Corn againſt the cold and moiſtneſs of the Winter Seaſon, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47781:23"/>
alſo to prevent Birds, Swine, Worms, and the like, from feeding on it. Husbandmen likewiſe obſerve to buy ſuch Seed as grew upon a poorer Ground than that on which they intend to ſow it: If the Seed be fair and full, it may do very well, but not otherwiſe; for 'tis with Grain as 'tis with Plants or Trees, the fuller and more thriving the better.</p>
               <p>The Seaſon for ſowing every ſort of Grain after its kind, muſt be left to the diſcretion of the prudent Husbandman, who muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the temper of his Land: If it be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Weeds, and in good heart and ſtrength, the later the Ground is ſown, the better will be the Crop for the purpoſe; Barley may be ſown in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> for being a quick grower, the very Dews will in a Weeks time bring it forth of the Earth, and by this means 'twill get a head over the Weeds, which require a longer time to ſhew themſelves, and will not be ſo apt to thrive in Hot Weather. But if the Ground be dry and ſandy, the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er any ſort of Corn is ſown in it, 'tis the better, for the heat of the Sun, join'd to that of the Earth, or Soil, will endanger the Crop, and make it turn yellow and wither; but if in caſe it prove a cool and wet Summer, it may do very well; ſo that maugre all the care and foreſight of the honeſt Husbandman, he muſt depend much upon the Diſpenſations of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her himſelf nor the wiſeſt man upon Earth can foreſee; and therefore both he and every man elſe, (how great and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47781:24"/>
ſoever) after he has caſt his buſineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beſt Method his Reaſon can propoſe, muſt ſtill depend upon Providence, as to the event, there being ſo many Accidents which may traverſe his Deſigns, and ſuch as can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be provided againſt, nor foreſeen.</p>
               <p>The ſame Diſcretion is to be uſed in the ſowing of Winter-Grain: For light, Sandy Ground, ſown late, will rarely bring forth a Crop, unleſs well ſtercorated; but being ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſown, the Seaſon of the Year will cheriſh the Seeds without danger of Weeds; whereas the Ground which is more fat and rich, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſubject to breed Weeds and Graſs, will quickly puſh them forth, and choak the good Grain in the coming forth; but when ſuch rich Ground is late ſown upon, there is no danger; for the Weeds will not ſtir towards Winter, and the Grain being lodg'd in the Earth, will weather out the Cold Seaſon well enough, and Spring too, when Graſs and Weeds are pincht by the Cold Weather.</p>
               <p>I doubt not of Winter Grain, as Wheat and Rye ſown in <hi>February,</hi> if the Seaſon be dry, and the Earth crumbling or mellow, but that it will be as forward as that which is ſown at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> or <hi>All-Hallon-tide,</hi> eſpecially if the Ground be well tempered, and clean from Weeds and Covet-Graſs, which Two Plowings will do; one, <hi>viz.</hi> as ſoon as the Crop is off the Ground, the other about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> if the Seaſon will permit: But the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Weather will diſcourage the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47781:24"/>
Husbandman; but in caſe, I ſay, the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould prove favourable, and a Man were otherways hindered from ſowing his Land at the uſual Seaſon, and that the Ground be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn'd and in good heart, I ſee no Reaſon for deſpairing of a Crop. But Husbandmen, eſpecially Farmers, like their Horſes and Teams, love ſtill to travel in a beaten Road; for ſhould they once miſcarry in a Project, beſides the Loſs of a Crop, they'd think they ſhould be laugh'd at by their Neighbours, and be pointed at in the Market: And hence it is that we rarely meet with any New Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Improvements of Husbandry from a laborious Farmer, the Streightneſs of whoſe Circumſtances will not ſuffer them to venture a certain Expence upon an uncertain Return, when the Method is new and unuſual, tho' he riſque the ſame thing daily, as to the Fruits of his Labour, which depend, as I have ſaid, upon many Contingences which lie beyond his Care and Foreſight.</p>
               <p>Snow does much preſerve Corn from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of Froſts and Winds, but above all, the Husbandman ought to have regard to keep his Furrows clean, and to make Furrows alſo ſloping croſs his Lands to drein the Gauls and carry off the Winter-Water, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more injurious. Beſides, the killing of Wants or Moles, which every Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman will be ſufficiently advertiſed of from his own daily Damage, more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Care ought to be had to his Furrows,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47781:25"/>
eſpecially at the bottoms of Lands: For tho' theſe pernicious Animals do a vaſt deal of Spoil by their Hillocks, 'tis much greater Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which they do by ſtopping up the Ends of the Furrows; for in ſuch Places 'tis that the Worms moſt reſort, and by conſequence the Wants, who feed upon them; ſo that I have known the ſame Place choak'd up three or four times afreſh during the Winter-Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Ground newly broke up may be ſown with ſome ſorts of Peaſe or Oats. Peaſe are better, and muſt be harrowed in after the Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but generally the Crop is not ſo good as upon temper'd Land, foraſmuch as it will be ſubject to Graſs and Weeds. After Peaſe, the Year following we may ſow Barley, for there will be time enough betwixt Harveſt and Barley-ſowing to give the Ground its due plowings. After the ſecond Crop it muſt be fallow'd and dreſs'd before 'twill yield ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs it be ſow'd with Oats, which will much impoveriſh the Ground. 'Tis the beſt Method therefore to let old Land, after it has been broken up, to lie fallow the firſt Year, and if in good proof, 'twill, with a little help, yield three Crops ſucceſſively.</p>
               <p>In leſſer Incloſures, which are converted to Tillage, I hold it the beſt Husbandry in the World, inſtead of head-Lands on which the Cattle turn, not to ſow them, but to let them lie plain for Graſs, as alſo a large Meer to be left, of ten or fourteen Yards breadth, under
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47781:25"/>
all the Hedges which incloſe the Tillage; for theſe Borders will never bear good Corn, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the Hedges be quick, and high, and ſtor'd with Trees; for the Shade of the Trees and Hedges, as alſo the Droppings from the Boughs, will deſtroy the Crop, as will alſo the Birds which lie continually in the Hedges. The Roots likewiſe of the Trees and Quick will rob the Corn of its due Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. Let the Borders round about there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be kept for Graſs, which as it is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the Eye, and moſt commodious for walking, ſo is it moſt profitable: For the Waſhings or Land-Floods running off the Furrows, will fatten the bordering Meer in an extraordinary manner, and make it as rich as any Meadow-Ground; as the Shade like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Trees and Hedges will as well help forward Graſs, how injurious ſoever they may be to Corn.</p>
               <p>After the Crop is in the Barn, being hous'd dry, the next thing the honeſt Labourer or Husbandman is to conſider of, is, to turn it into Money. Peradventure the ſafeſt way will be to thraſh it out, as ſoon as the Seaſon does require, and to ſend it to the Market; for by long lying in the Barn, Rats and Mice will quickly draw their Mines, and make large Inroads; nor will the Thief be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Occaſion ſhall ſerve, to give a Caſt of his Skill; to which we may add the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Barn for the Crop of a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Year. To keep it thraſh'd in the Granary
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47781:26"/>
is altogether as bad; for 'twill be ſubject to the Aſſaults of Vermine, and unleſs often turn'd 'twill grow muſty: Beſides, 'twill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a great deal of Duſt and Filth, and the Grains of Corn will ſhrink or ſhrivle, and loſe their bright Colour: All which will be of much more Detriment than what may be recompenc'd from the Advance of the Market, which commonly does lurch us by ſinking lower, but rarely riſing to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to make amends for the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences we meet with by keeping in our Corn.</p>
               <p>But if it be judg'd expedient to keep Grain, the beſt way is in the Straw, by putting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Rick, not rais'd upon Poſts or Pillars of Wood, or of much Stone (as is uſual with ordinary Husbandmen) but let the Frame of Wood which is to bear up the Rick, be laid upon five or nine Pillars, a full Yard from the Ground. The Pillars muſt be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Burthen, being made round and ſtrong, and finely plaiſter'd over, and cover'd with flat ſquare Stones, four Foot in breadth each, to prevent Vermine from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up: For if the Pillars be ſquare, tho' never ſo poliſh'd, Rats and Mice will run up the Corners; but on a round one they have not the leaſt Hold for their Claws. The Rick alſo muſt be well thatch'd, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Damage from foul Weather; and by this means Grain may be preſerv'd ſweet and entire for many Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47781:26"/>
There is this Thing farther which I would recommend to the Conſideration of every Husbandman, (eſpecially if he be a Gentleman,) <hi>viz.</hi> to avoid as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Covering of his Barns and Out-Houſes with Straw: For beſides that ſuch Thatch'd Coverings looks mean and begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis certain that they will prove far more expenſive than Tyling in a little Proceſs of Time. People are eaſily drawn to follow the Examples of the Country, to avoid a little greater Charge for the preſent, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that ſuch Thatch'd Houſes will be a continual Reparation and Expence: Every violent Guſt or Puff of Wind tears them to pieces, and makes vaſt Breaches: Unluckey Birds are ſtill pulling them, and the Rain, Snow; and Weather, will in a very ſhort time rot ſuch Coverings, and conſiderable Damage be ſuſtain'd before Stuff and Thatcher can be brought in place. Whereas the Tiled Roofs, tho' a little more chargeable at firſt, will laſt a long while without Repair; and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, it will be done at a quarter the Charge of Straw Roofs. 'Tis true, Thatch'd Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are a better Security for Corn againſt Rain and Snow; but then 'tis known too, that they harbour Birds, Rats, Mice, with other Vermine, and above all are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, ſo that many Houſes have been burnt to the Ground, and whole Families undone
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47781:27"/>
by Fire catching in the Thatch. But in this and many other Methods, Country Fellows will never quit the old Road, how Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Inconvenient ſoever it be, no more than the <hi>Iriſh</hi> can be wean'd from their old barbarous Cuſtom of Tailing their Horſes to one another, and to draw with them in their Teams.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>PAſturage</hi> is of ſeveral ſorts: That wherein Sheep thrive beſt is the Lawnes, as alſo the wide and open Downs, ſuch as thoſe in <hi>Cotſwold</hi> and in <hi>Wiltſhire;</hi> for what is richer or ranker, by reaſon of the great Dews that lie upon them, is apt to beget the Rot; alſo hilly Ground, in which are many Springs and little Lakes, is very unwholſome: For where Sheep bite cloſeſt they thrive beſt, unleſs they be deſign'd for the Butcher, and then they muſt have a fuller Diet. There is no ſmall Care to be taken in ordering the Paſture of ſuch as are deſign'd for Breed or Store: Let them be kept in the Summer as bare as poſſible; for if they once come to abate their Fleſh, as certainly they will towards Winter, they will be a long time before they will come about; but being hard kept in the Summer, and diſpos'd into thriving Paſture towards Winter, they will keep their Fleeces whole upon their Backs, and be able to weather out the ſharpeſt of that Seaſon. Of the Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fallow-Fields we have ſpoken before. Woods and rough Grounds are very hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for Sheep, for beſides the Danger they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47781:28"/>
are in of tearing their Fleeces, and ſometimes of being hang'd in the Briars, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Diſeaſe called the <hi>Wood-Evil,</hi> which is a Bladder of Water gathering in the Head, which makes them turn round, and ſo they will continue in the ſame place, and in that giddy turning Condition, till they die. When a Sheep therefore is taken with this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the Butcher muſt cure him.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, young Cattle thrive beſt in rough woody Grounds, by reaſon of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and the large Walks ſuch Places yield; and by this means they are defended from the Fly and the Breeze. The Graſs likewiſe of ſuch Places, tho' courſe and ſoure, agrees well enough with young Cattle, which would not pay for their Keeping were they to feed in richer Paſture. Horſes, eſpecially where we would have a good Breed, require likewiſe a large Walk, and woody, ſuch as thoſe in Parks, which are dry and hard at the bottom, and withal ſtony, yet cover'd with a ſweet Turf, and abounding with freſh Springs, Thickets, and ſome Lawnes or Paſturage diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd in Valleys, and fatned with little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volets. And upon this Score it is, that the Northern Parts afford the beſt Horſes; for the Ground being poor they can afford them a larger Range, which helps their Wind, and teaches them to uſe their Legs, and the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ground makes their Heels tough and hard.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:47781:28"/>
As for the Dayry, as alſo for the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Cattle, and the like, the better the Paſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the better the Return. If the Ground be over-grown with Couch or Foggy Graſs, the beſt way will be to eat it down in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with hungry, hardy Cattle; and in the Spring, when the young Graſs begins to peep out of the Ground, as certainly it will, and ſooner than in other Paſturage, by reaſon of the thick dead Couch or Graſs which keeps it warm, and defends it from the Winds and Froſts, then is the time to turn in Cattle, and eſpecially Horſes, which taſting of the young ſpringing Graſs, will pluck up the dead and wither'd together with it; afterwhich, let it be eaten bare with Sheep, which as they feed will fatten the Ground with their Dung, and by this means will the Ground be brought to a fine ſweet Turf.</p>
               <p>Paſture-Grounds are improv'd ſeveral ways at firſt; by ſowing of Foreign Seeds, ſuch as <hi>Clover, St. Foin,</hi> and the like; all which Seeds muſt be ſown along with the Grain, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, the Ground being prepar'd or made very fine: And by this means, when the Grain, which ought to be Barley, is above Ground, and grown to ſome ſtrength, the Seed, whether of <hi>Clover,</hi> or of <hi>St. Foin,</hi> for the purpoſe will be ſpringing up, without Prejudice to the Crop, and keep back and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Weeds, which otherways would endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Corn, and poiſon the Ground for ſome time after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:47781:29"/>
                  <hi>Clover</hi> thrives almoſt in all ſorts of Ground, unleſs very ſtony or very wet Land; but 'tis moſt proper for a mix'd Land, ſuch as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of a Sand, and ſomething a fatter Glebe. The ſame Manurement or Dreſſing which ſerves for Barley will ſerve likewiſe for <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> which will laſt good in the Ground for three Years; by which means that Land which was not worth a Noble an Acre, will be worth 30 <hi>s.</hi> an Acre. This ſort of Graſs may be mow'd twice a Year; the firſt Crop ſerves for Hay, the ſecond they cut for Seed about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> when the Bloſſoms are fully wither'd for it muſt lie withering on the Ground for ſome time, and be hous'd very dry, which is ſomething difficult, by reaſon of the long Dews and the declining Sun at this Seaſon of the Year. This ſort of Graſs is very good for Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to feed Pigs, and fatten Sheep. But for Cattle, as Cows or Oxen, if they be turn'd in hungry they will be in danger of over-filling themſelves, and by this means to ſwell and burſt; for this ſort of Food is exceeding ſweet and luſcious. The way then is to turn in Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle when they are full, tho' at the beſt this ſort of Food is not ſo kind for them as Graſs. When the <hi>Clover</hi> is worn out of the Ground, as generally it laſts not above three or four Years at moſt, the Ground will quickly come to a graſſy Turf; ſo that I hold it abſolutely neceſſary for every one who lays down his Ground ſor Paſturage, to leave it with <hi>Clover.</hi> This ſort of Improvement is much practis'd in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47781:29"/>
                  <hi>Herefordſhire, Worceſterſhire,</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>Gloceſterſhire;</hi> and after ſome little Interval of Time, it may be renew'd again upon the ſame Ground, and ſo on; the Soil being firſt duly dreſs'd and prepar'd for Corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Foin,</hi> where it likes the Ground, is much more profitable than <hi>Clover,</hi> becauſe of longer Continuance: It requires a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Soil from <hi>Clover,</hi> for it thrives beſt in a hilly, ſtony, cold, and barren Ground, but dry, ſuch as that in the higher Parts of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire, Oxfordſhire,</hi> and other Places of the Kingdom. This ſort of Graſs may be mow'd from Year to Year, for divers Years together; and when it dies, after a few Years Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the ſowing of it may be renew'd again upon the ſame Ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fodder is exceeding good for Horſes, and not unkind for Cattle; ſo that by means hereof, the Ground which before was not worth Two Shillings an Acre, ſhall be worth Twenty Shillings an Acre, and better. The Reaſon why <hi>St. Foin</hi> thrives ſo well in dry, ſtony, barren Ground, is this: It is a Plant which ſhoots its ſmall fibrous Roots a great depth in the Ground, deeper far than Grain or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Herbs, which, by reaſon of the ſtony Surface, cannot run low; whereas <hi>St. Foin</hi> creeps deep by its Roots betwixt the Joints of the Stones, where the Vegitative Nutriment cannot be ſuck'd by ſuch Plants as feed upon the Surface, which generally lies no deeper than the Plow. And becauſe <hi>St. Foin</hi> requires
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47781:30"/>
a dry Soil, ſuch barren, dry Ground is moſt ſit for it; the ſtony Surface and the declining Situation utterly forbidding any Moiſture to ſink far into it.</p>
               <p>Clover likewiſe ſhoots down a good depth, but not ſo deep as St. Foin, and is in a ſhort time ſupplanted by other Herbs, foraſmuch as it proſpers beſt in a thriving and looſe Soil, and generally we may obſerve, that ſuch Herbs as are perennial, ſhoot deep, roots downwards, as Hops, Docks, Ferne, Broom, Nettles, and the like, whereas they which are annual, ly ſhallow on the Surface.</p>
               <p>Ray or Rye Grain is a ſpiry benty ſort of Graſs, and is another kind of improvement, much of the ſame continuance with Clover, and thrives beſt in Cold, Wet and Gauly Ground; it is not ſo much in Vogue as Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or St. Foin.</p>
               <p>Another way of improving Paſturage is by Soil, or dreſſing of the Ground, ſuch as Dung which has been rotting ſome Years; as likewiſe Shovelings of Folds, and the Mud of Pools and Ditches after two or three Years mellowing. But I know not any thing which improves Paſturage more than Mault-Duſt; ſo that every one who Trades in ſelling of Mault, may ſecurely promiſe himſelf, that the Duſt and Winnowings of his Mault, after it has lain ſome time, will prove a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of his Gain.</p>
               <p>The Improvement of Paſturage by water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is next to be conſider'd: For if it be by a

Land-Flood, and conveniently diſtributed by Furrows, it is of great advantage; but if the Water ly long upon it, it chills the Ground, and makes it bring forth Ruſhes, and ſuch like Traſh, or a ſort of thin, withern, ſtarv'd Graſs, but above all, where a Ground is well dreſs'd with rotten Dung or Earth, and a Land-Flood, or other Water can conveniently be brought over it, without much waſhing or ſtay, it muſt needs make the Ground very fruitful. The Seaſon of dreſſing Paſture is in the Froſt: For then the Wheels will not cut into the Earth, and after the Froſt is over the Compoſt or Earth which is laid on, will be crumbly and moulder. For certain it is, that the finer the Earth or Compoſt which is thrown upon it is, the more Graſs it will yield: Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that Paſture Grounds bordering upon great Roads, are more fruitful in Graſs than others; for the Duſt which is raiſed in them, being carried by the Wind, and falling upon the tender Herbs, the next Shower car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it eaſily to the Roots, ſo that all parts of the Ground is alike Powdered with this ſort of Duſt, which is generally fatter than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Earth by reaſon of the Dungings of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and Traſh which is commonly caſt into the High-ways.</p>
               <p>Any Ground which lies upon the Hangings of a Hill and has a Pool or Currant above it, is highly to be valued: For ſuch Ground may be watered at any time, and the Water will be ſure not to ſtand upon it, which is a thing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47781:31"/>
moſt pernicious to Paſture; and if ſuch hanging Ground as I am ſpeaking of be lightly dreſs'd with Earth before the Water is turn'd over it, 'twill bring forth Graſs in abundance. I have known ſome, who having the advantage of a Pool at the Head of a declining Ground, have thrown into the Water a great deal of Soil or Dung, and all the time of watering their Ground, have ordered a Horſe or two to be rid or walk'd up and down the Pool during the running of the Water; ſo that four or five Loads of Dung thus caſt into it, will help the Ground better than five times as much clean Dung caſt or ſpread upon the Ground; for the muddy fat Water will be ſure to find the Root of every Herb, whereas Dung laid upon the Ground, tho' never ſo well ſpread, will lie in little heaps, and a good part of it will dry or burn away without any Benefit.</p>
               <p>Lime thrown upon Paſture, if chill and cold, will bring it to a fine thick Mat of Graſs; but whether the Benefit will anſwer the Coſt and Charge, unleſs it be where Lime is very cheap, I leave to the Husbandman's Pocket to conſider. To mix Lime with Earth firſt, and ſo let them lie together in a heap, bakeing, is no good way; for the Lime, when ſlack'd, will make the Earth as hard almoſt as a Rock, ſo that being to be ſpread upon the Ground, 'twill lie in great Cakes or Flakes, and will not be turn'd to a Powder till the Strength and Virtue of the Lime is ſpent. The beſt way therefore is to lay the Lime in little heaps, (as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47781:31"/>
we do upon Tillage,) and after it is ſlack'd, and caſt into the Air, the Wind will ſcatter the Powder of it finely upon the Ground, which the next Shower of Rain, or the very Dews of the Night, will convey gradually to the Roots of the Graſs.</p>
               <p>The laſt way of Improving Paſture-Grounds is by freeing them from ſuch things as do annoy and hurt them, ſuch as Ants, Broom, Fern, Wood-wax, or Dyers-weed, Docks, Thiſtles, Nettles, and the like. As for Ants, the time of deſtroying them is in the beginning of Winter, by digging up their Hillocks, and ſinking their Holes lower than the Level of the Ground, throwing the Core or Earth, which is dug out of the Hole, into an empty Cart, and caſting it into a Pool of Water, for by throwing it upon the Ground, they will revive again in the Spring, and raiſe new Heaps, after they have endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d all the Severities of the Winter-Seaſon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Rain or Froſt; ſo that, after two or three Years, for one Hillock you ſhall have a dozen: For I have found by Experience, that Ants which have been frozen up in Clods of Earth as hard as the Stone, will crawl about and work again in the Spring. They then who would practiſe this Method of Husbandry, by digging out the Core, muſt quar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er the Turf of the Hillocks firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Core is taken out, turn the Turf in outerly, and ſo cover the hole, leaving it ſunk a little lower than the ordinary Surface of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47781:32"/>
Ground, as I ſaid before, that ſo the Water may ſink in and kill them; for there is no deſtroying them but by Water. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod likewiſe muſt be practis'd at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Winter, that there may be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Water to ſoak them; tho' af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the ſureſt way to deſtroy theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Vermine, is to plow up the Ground and Till it with Corn; for this will do the Buſineſs effectually, and for many Years: And truly all Paſture-Grounds whatſoever, will call for this Method of Husbandry once in twenty Years, by which means the Graſs will come up the ſweeter and better, if the Ground be laid down in good heart. But if this Method ſhall not prove ſucceſsful, the laſt and ſureſt Remedy the Husbandman can have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, is to graze the Ground ſo turn'd, as I have before deſcrib'd, with Sheep, for the following Year; for theſe Cattle, by nipping the Graſs cloſe to the Ground, and by often walking over it, keep down the Ants; for 'tis by the Spring-Graſs they climb up, and make their Hillocks in the Summer, where you may ſee them climb up a foot high, up to the tops of Graſs, carrying up Earth and faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the ſides; therefore all which is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally avoided, I ſay, by keeping the Graſs down by the Teeth and Feet of ſuch Sheep.</p>
               <p>Broom is another Enemy to Paſturage, and to deſtroy it the moſt effectual way is, to let it grow for three or four Years, and when it is in Bloſſom, (as it will be in <hi>May)</hi> to cut it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47781:32"/>
with a Hook pretty cloſe to the Ground; for then it is that all the Sap and Strength of the Plant is up, and being cut off, I ſay, the ſcorching Heat of the Summer will make the remaining Stub to wither and die, and conſequently the Root, there being nothing to draw it: But they who practiſe this ſort of Husbandry muſt be ſure to leave no young under-ſhoots of Broom; for ſuch, tho' they ſeem never ſo inconſiderable, will quickly draw the Root and get to a head. They who endeavour to kill Broom by plowing, or ſtocking of it up, do throw away their Money and Time, for it will come up ten times thicker than before. Sowing the Ground with Clover will go a great way in deſtroying of Broom, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will utterly kill it, by reaſon it draws a ſtronger Juice; but, above all, the ſowing of <hi>St. Foin,</hi> without all diſpute, will utterly kill it, foraſmuch as it goes much deeper into the Ground than the Roots of Broom, and engroſſes or draws all the vegetative Virtue of the Earth unto it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The way to deſtroy Fern is to whip off the young Heads of it with a Switch as ſoon as it peeps out of the Ground; for then 'tis very tender, and will weep or bleed exceedingly: This being done five or ſix times in a Year, (for ſo often will it get head again,) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd under this Method for two Years, it will utterly deſtroy it. A Boy in an Hour's time may whip off the heads of ſo much Fern as will poiſon an Acre of Ground; ſo that ten
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47781:33"/>
or twelve Hours Labour beſtow'd upon a piece of Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> an Hour at a time, will purge a Field from this devouring Weed: For by often whipping of it, it bleeds and is bruis'd, and the ſcorching Sun withers it in the ſame way as I have before deſcrib'd in Broom.</p>
               <p>Dyers-weed, or Wood-wax, where it grows, is a moſt pernicious Weed; it robs the Ground exceedingly, and its Bitterneſs will not ſuffer any Cattle to eat it, nor will it be deſtroy'd by mowing. The only way I could ever find, is to graze the Ground which is peſter'd with it, by Sheep, and eat it bare; for Sheep bite cloſe, and love this ſort of Herb very well, and it is ſaid moreover to preſerve them from the Rot; and the Hay or Fother made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is good for them in the Winter.</p>
               <p>As for Thiſtles, they are not to be deſtroy'd as Fern, by cutting: Breaking-up and ſowing the Ground with Clover is the beſt way to kill them, and ſometimes they will die of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: The like alſo may be ſaid of Docks, Nettles, and ſuch-like Traſh, which proceed commonly from the indigeſted Rankneſs of the Soil. Liming of the Ground, whether Tillage or Paſture, does very much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Suppreſſion of theſe Weeds.</p>
               <p>Moſs is a great Impoveriſher of Ground, and is the pure Effect of old Age, or of worn out Nature; ſo that growing in a kind of thick Mat or Scurf upon the Surface of the Earth, it robs the Herbs of their due Nouriſhment;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47781:33"/>
or more probably, I ſay, the Earth being worn out of heart, is able to put forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this dry kind of Traſh: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' dreſſing the Ground with rich Earth or Dung may encourage the Earth to put forth anew, yet 'twill never anſwer the Charge and ſoon return to Moſs again; like an old over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn Man, who, tho' he may get a little Strength and Warmth, by means of a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and nouriſhing Diet, yet as ſoon as that's withdrawn, Nature relapſes to its former State of Languor and Imbecility. There is no other way then to deſtroy Moſs, but by breaking-up ſuch Paſture and tilling it with Corn; for this brings up the Mould which for a long time lay under the Turf, which being expos'd to the Sun and Dews, quickly acquires a prolifick or vegetative Virtue.</p>
               <p>The dividing of Paſture-Grounds into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cloſes is not the moſt profitable; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Vexation and Expence one will be at perpetually in making and repairing ſuch Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as alſo the Loſs of Ground by Hedges and Ditches, certain 'tis that Cattle thrive far better in a large Walk; for the Graſs which grows under the Droppings of Trees is ſoure and traſhy, and in the Summer-Seaſon, when Cattle are ſubject to the Breeze, they will not be ſo apt to break out where they have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to range. Likewiſe 'tis much more eaſie to have Water in a large Field of forty Acres, than to furniſh the ſame with Water when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſix or ſeven little Grounds; ſor in ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47781:34"/>
great a Space as a Field of forty Acres, 'tis ten to one but we may find ſome one place which may ſerve the Neceſſities of Cattle: But to find the like Convenience in divers Parts or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſame Ground, is very rare and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; ſo that I dare boldly affirm, that a piece of Ground of ten Acres will keep a Stock of Cattle longer than ſour Cloſes of three Acres each, tho' of the ſame Nature and Goodneſs: For in leſſer Grounds Cattle quickly walk o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and being ſullied and ſtained with their Feet, they will not care to feed thereon; whereas in larger Fields they have room to range and feed till the ſtained Places be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd with Rain or with the Dews.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOunds</hi> and <hi>Fences</hi> are Matters of great Moment in Husbandry, and they are of two ſorts, being either Dead or Quick. Dead Fences are Banks or Bulwarks of Earth, Stone Walls, Pales, Ditches, or Current of Water, and the like: For unleſs theſe things be put in good order, all our Induſtry about our Paſturage and Tillage will ſignifie but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle whilſt they lie expos'd to Treſpaſſings and Waſt.</p>
               <p>As for Banks of Earth they are moſt us'd near Cities, where 'tis impoſſible almoſt to raiſe a Quick-Hedge, by reaſon of the great Numbers of Poor who inhabite the Out-skirts, who upon all Occaſions, and eſpecially in cold Weather, will make Plunder of whatſoever is combuſtible. The great Multitude likewiſe of Citizens and of idle Perſons, walking for their Pleaſure, as alſo of Gentlemen and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People reſorting continually to Cities, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore of Marketing, and other Buſineſs, all Incloſures of this kind will unavoidably be laid waſt, eſpecially in the Winter-Seaſon, and 'twill require ſome Years for the Repair of a Quickſet-Hedge; whereas Banks of Earth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47781:35"/>
are eaſily mended, and not eaſily aſſaulted by Horſemen, nor liable to be ſpoil'd upon the account of Fewel: Such kind of Fences are very proper for Corn, there being no Harbour for Birds, nor Shade; but for Paſturage they are not ſo convenient, as affording neither Shelter againſt the Sun or Weather.</p>
               <p>Fences of Pales are us'd generally about Parks, the ruggedneſs of the Clefts being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to hinder Deer from breaking out. It is eaſie alſo to open or ſhut a Breach, by removing or pinning two or three Poles, a thing very convenient for an Incloſure of Chace.</p>
               <p>Stone Walls are too chargeable, unleſs in ſuch Places where the Ground is naturally dry and ſtony, as on <hi>Cotſwold</hi> Hills; for there the Stones lie in all Places ready to hand, there being no more to be done but to lay them orderly upon one another: And this kind of Stone-work, laid dry, and without Mortar, will continue for Ages. As for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, or Streams of Running-Water, they are the beſt Boundaries of all: For beſides the Advantage derivable to the Ground by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, they afford infinite Pleaſure and Profit by Fiſh, and ſerving the Occaſions of Cattle, and ſometimes alſo by Traffick, as in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and likewiſe in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where thoſe rich Meadows are at the ſame time wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by an infinite Number of Trenches or Channels all cut by hand, and repleniſh'd with great Variety of Fiſh. As for Ditches
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47781:35"/>
fill'd with dead or ſtanding Water, they are induſtriouſly to be avoided, as affording in the Summer-Seaſon moſt noiſome Smells and Vapours, breeding great quantities of Flies and Inſects, as their Water is moſt unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous for Cattle.</p>
               <p>Quickſet-Hedges conſiſt generally of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Hazle, Hip-briar, Brambles, the Black and White Thorn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Holly is better rais'd by Berries than by Sets, tho' there be but few who deſignedly plant them, but in the Walks of Gardens, and then, I ſay, they are rais'd by Berries, and are eſteem'd for being ever Green, and for their Red Fruit or Berries. The Holly which is edg'd or fring'd with a ſilver kind of Thread is accounted very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental in the choiceſt Gardens. Holly has this Advantage above all other Quicks, for it will thrive beſt among great Trees, as Oaks' and Elms, eſpecially Elms; when other Quicks will not grow, by reaſon of the ſtrong Nouriſhment which ſuch greater Trees draw, to the Conſumption of what is planted near them.</p>
               <p>Hazle, tho' a quick grower where it likes the Ground, ought not deſignedly to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for the Leaves and Skirts being extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſweet and tender, all ſorts of Cattle prey moſt eagerly upon it, to the ruine of a Hedge. Hip and Haws, as well as Hazle, are beſt planted by Birds and Vermine: For ſuch Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atures making Nuts and Berries to be their ordinary Food, fly with them, or carry
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47781:36"/>
them from Place to Place, and ſo dropping them up and down the Hedges, or elſe hiding them under Ground, at Spring ſome will be ſure to ſprout. Brambles grow naturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough we may ſuppoſe; tho' 'tis true too, that the Seeds of Black-berries, ſcatter'd by Birds, or otherwiſe, up and down the Hedges, beget a large Encreaſe; and the Shoots or Strings of them running along the Ground, quickly take root, (as we ſee in Straw-berries) and will over-run the Ground, if not timely ſubdued.</p>
               <p>But the two common Quickſets, by which Husbandmen raiſe their Hedges, are the Black and White Thorn, call'd the Haw-Thorn. As for the Black Thorn, the Quicks or Sets are not very apt to grow, but where they once take root they are never to be deſtroy'd, and they make the beſt Fence of any; for it is hardy and ſtubborn, and by being a prickly Shrub, Cattle are not apt to bruiſe it: One Inconveniency it has, that it is apt to ſpread wider than it ſhould do, by ſending forth new Shoots from the Root at ſome diſtance from the Hedge, and, if not carefully look'd after, will quickly over-run a Ground. The White or Haw-Thorn is the moſt uſual Quick which the Husbandman makes uſe of for the raiſing of Hedges; for the Sets are good Greens, and withal thorny and prickly; but the Leaves or tender Buds being ſweet, Cattle, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sheep, will endanger them very much, if not carefully prevented, either by waſhing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47781:36"/>
them with Lime, or by making Dead Fences before them till they be grown out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>The Seaſon for planting of Quick, holds good from the beginning of <hi>December</hi> to the middle of <hi>February,</hi> and ſometimes later, if the Spring be backward. 'Tis infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to plant Quick on the Ditch-ſide than on the Field-ſide; for on the Field-ſide they will be ſure to be nipp'd with Cattle, but on the Ditch-ſide the Sets are ſafe from the drying Sun, as alſo from Cattle which graize on the Field-ſide, eſpecially if ſome Shrubs, Buſhes of Black Thorn, be prick'd in over them with the Stakes which make the Dead Hedges.</p>
               <p>Some in planting of Hedges will ſet Acorns, Aſh-keys, Crab-quicks, and the like: But I look not upon this Method to be ſo profitable to the Hedge; for ſuch Trees, when grown up to any bigneſs, will rob the Hedge Wood of its due Nouriſhment, and leave Gaps near the Bodies of ſuch Trees, and will ſtand in need of continual Repair; and altho' the Crop of ſuch over-grown Trees may ſerve for Fuel, yet I look upon it to be a much better Hedge which ſhall never ſtand in need of Repair, as I have ſaid before. However it be, every Man may follow that which he finds moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Cutting or Plaſhing of Hedges is another thing which we are to have regard to, which beſides that it muſt be done in due Seaſon, that is, in the Winter, or very early in the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47781:37"/>
Spring, great care is to be had furthermore to the manner of cutting: A felling or down-right Blow is too apt to make a Cleft in the Stub, which will rot and deaden; it is better therefore to cut upwards, if one can conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently come at it. Likewiſe we muſt be ſure to leave good ſtore of buſhy Thorns or Broom on the ſides of the Quick-Hedges; for theſe ſerve for a Defence to keep off Cattle from brouzing upon the tender Shoots of a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſh'd Hedge; and after two Years time, ſuch Shoots will grow ſtrong and be out of the reach of Cattle, and then we may ſafely cut away or trim off the Under-growings or buſhy Fuel for our Occaſions: Whereas he who cuts the top of a Hedge, and the under-wood or ſide Spriggs all at once, endangers the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Fence, the Cattle having free ſcope and liberty to nip off the tender Buds in all Places as faſt as they ſhoot out.</p>
               <p>For the ſame Reaſon likewiſe I hold it not good Husbandry to be over-curious in grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing up of Thorns or Buſhes which grow near a Quick-Hedge; for theſe are, as it were, the Out-works which preſerve the main Fence ſafe, which being once cut away, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Fence lies open to the Injuries of Cattle. When a Hedge is grown very old, and ſtubby, 'tis beſt to cut it up at the Butt, leaving only here and there a Layer or Pleacher, the Mould being firſt caſt up carefully to the Bank, to cheriſh the Roots of ſuch Thorns or Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood from whence the dead Stuff was cut:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47781:37"/>
For the Safety and Defence whereof a dead Hedge muſt be made at two Yards diſtance, the Bruſh lying on the Field-ſide to keep off Cattle from doing Miſchief, whilſt the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid Hedge is a recovering. This Art of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, or double Hedging, is not to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd but where there is plenty of Tynnel, and there the Charge or Expence is no other but the Hire of Tyning, which is inconſiderable, and after three Years time it may be taken away ready cut and dried for the Fire. In all dead Gaps of Hedges 'tis very expedient to make the Stakes of Sally or Withy, for they will prove quick, and grow, and afford plentiful Matter for the Repair of Hedges from time to time.</p>
               <p>There is a ſort of dead Hedging which is commonly practis'd with good Advantage, eſpecially near Lanes, and that is by pricking or ſticking Thorns ſlant or ſlope-ways upon the Bank, and covering the bottoms of them with Turf. This ſort of Fence will hold good for a Year or two, and has this Advantage, that as Cattle will not deſtroy it by brouzing, ſo neither will it be in danger of being dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd by Hedge-breakers, there being nothing which may tempt them thereunto, as in Stake-Hedges, where the Tynnel is of much greater Subſtance. This ſort of Hedging is of very little Charge, and where a Breach is made it is eaſily repair'd; only Care muſt be took from time to time, as the Bank ſhall waſh away into the hollow Road and Ditch on the other ſide,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47781:38"/>
not to repair it by digging new Earth on the Fields-ſide to cover the Thorns; for by this means the Ground will in time be waſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, leaving a deep Ditch or Trench behind. The way then muſt be to caſt up the Earth which is mouldred down into the hollow way, and ſo repair the Bank or Bulwark; which, tho' it be a little more troubleſome, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Ground from being waſted by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent digging.</p>

               <p>EVery Man that is a Member of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth may be conſider'd in a double Capacity: Firſt, as he ſtands alone, and in his Private and Domeſtick Capacity; Next, as he is a Member of a Body, and in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and Civil Capacity. If we conſider him under the firſt Circumſtance, we muſt look upon him as a Creature acting upon Self-Intereſt, whether it be in getting and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Fortune by Induſtry and Labour; by Traffick, by Cunning, by Study, Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Preferments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by ſecuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Wrong, or by providing for and advancing his Family; and, in a word, by gratifying his Deſires in all true or imaginary Enjoyments, and Contents, whether they concern his own Perſon or thoſe who are nearly related to and dependent on him.</p>
               <p>But then, as he is a Member of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, his Duty extends it ſelf much farther; for 'tis with the Body-Politick as with the Body-Natural: If any one Member ſhall refuſe to be beneficial to its Fellows, it muſt not expect the like Relief from them; by which means there will follow ſuch a kind of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47781:39"/>
Jarring or Diſcord amongſt the Parts of the Body, as will draw on a Diſtemper and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Diſſolution, which cannot but be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the diſagreeing Members themſelves. 'Tis true, it concerns every Man to provide for his own private Affairs in the firſt place, for if he leaves it for others to do it for him, he will quickly find himſelf in a very naked Condition, ſo prevalent is Self-Intereſt, which will firſt begin and many times end at home. And yet all this while, a Man, whilſt he is thus buſie about his private Intereſt, differs very little from Brutes: For theſe know very well what is for their own good, and will labour always to procure the ſame; many of which are as ſagacious and provident for their future Benefit, as the moſt ſubtle and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious of Humane Race. Duties therefore of this kind may be called Animal or Senſitive, as being common with Men and Beaſts as they are living Creatures. But Duties which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Publick are of a higher and more diſtinguiſhing Nature, as being of a larger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and carry ſome Marks of Divinity on them, foraſmuch as they level at the General Good, by promoting Peace and Juſtice, and ſerve conſequently to render Kingdoms and future Ages ſtable and flouriſhing, and muſt be eſteem'd therefore to be much more noble than the former, as being founded in Reaſon and Prudence, and diffuſing their Influence over all the World.</p>

Now to apply theſe Notions to the Point in queſtion; and firſt, It is, queſtionleſs, the Inclination of every Man to improve his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate as much as he can by the Arts of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, as we may ſuppoſe in our preſent Caſe, by ſowing his Ground with Foreign Seeds, ſuch as <hi>St. Foin, Clover,</hi> &amp;c. But whether it be for the Intereſt of the Commonwealth to countenance and permit ſuch Improvements may be a Queſtion: For if it ſhall appear that ſuch Plantations are Injurious to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, according to what's already premis'd, the Government has Power to reſtrain Men from purſuing their Domeſtick and Private, Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when it ſhall be to the Detriment of the ſame Perſons, as they ſtand engag'd in a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Body or Society.</p>
               <p>The Conſiderations tempting us to believe that ſuch Innovations in Husbandry ought to be permitted, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Beſides the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which a vaſt Number of Perſons reap from Improvements of this nature, certain it is, that great Numbers of Cattle are rais'd this way, and conſequently more Corn, becauſe more Dung: Nor can <hi>Clover,</hi> for the purpoſe, be continu'd but for a little time without Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. Now the more Corn and Cattle are rais'd, the cheaper muſt all Proviſions be, which is generally look'd upon to be a Benefit to the Publick.</p>
               <p>This Reaſon, how ſpecious and popular ſoever it may ſeem upon the firſt Appearance, will, upon a nearer View, be found to be very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47781:40"/>
thin and fallacious: And firſt, If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Intereſt of Private Perſons, what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there that ſome Private Perſons ſhould be ſuffer'd to grow rich and get Eſtates by the Loſs of a far greater Number of Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, no leſs Induſtrious and Honeſt than their Neighbours? 'Tis true, where Men riotou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly or ſottiſhly waſt their Eſtates, their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may gather Sticks, and into the Bargain make themſelves warm by the Fire of them: But for the Primitive, Ancient, and Native ways of Paſturage, ſo uſeful and neceſſary to the Nation, as thoſe of Graizing and of the Dairy, to be ſupplanted, with all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies thereon depending, by the Invaſion of Foreigners, may be as miſchievous to the good old Husbandman as any other Invaſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſuch as aſſault us by open force, or of thoſe more dangerous ones who endeavour to trapan us by fraudulent Cajolery.</p>
               <p>The Plantation of Tobacco in <hi>England</hi> is a Production certainly which would be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to a world of People both Planters and Smoakers; and yet we find that it hath been deſtroy'd by Publick Order, from time to time, as faſt as ever it grew up; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ruin'd others who before were ſettled in a Trade: Why then there ſhould not be the ſame Reaſon againſt <hi>Clover, St. Foin, Rye-Graſs,</hi> and other Foreign Weeds, we are yet to learn, eſpecially when we conſider the Duties or Payments, whether Parochial or Publick, with which Ancient Eſtates are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47781:40"/>
For tho' it be certainly true, that Meadow and Feeding Grounds are fallen at leaſt Fifteen <hi>per Cent.</hi> ſince the Importation of theſe Foreign ſorts of Graſs, yet are they liable to the ſame Rates or Payments with which they were charg'd before they were impoveriſh'd by theſe Outlandiſh Uſurpers; whereas Lands, which the laſt Year, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, were not worth above Five Shillings an Acre, after they are ſown with <hi>Clover</hi> or <hi>St. Foin,</hi> are worth, yearly, Twenty five or Thirty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Advance of Profit, are in a manner ſcot-free, paying only after the Proportion of their old Rents, upon Pretence, forſooth, that no Man ought to pay for his Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which thing is falſe both in Reaſon and Practice. But that Lands, on the other hand, which ſink in their Value by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of others, ſhould be ſtill ſtretch'd upon the Rack, whilſt the Productions which undermine them return triple Profit to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, without Augmentation of Duty, are Maxims very unpolitick, irrational, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. The Ancient Fundamental Courſe which has been found profitable and uſeful for ſo many Ages, ought not to be expel'd by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Upſtarts, which, tho' upon the Account of their Novelty, they may get ſome Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Followers, will be found in the Cloſe to be of miſchievous Conſequence to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as will appear farther, if we conſider the ſecond General Argument offer'd on their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47781:41"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the Plenty and Encreaſe of Corn and Cattle.</p>
               <p>'Tis very true, by means of theſe foreign Growths more Corn and Cattle are rais'd than would be otherwiſe; but this ſtill is no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Publick, when the Abundance and Plenty ſhall lower the Price: For every one knows that 'tis more Profit to have one Buſhel of Corn which ſhall bring him Five Shillings than to ſell two Buſhels of the ſame Grain for Six; becauſe, when things are dear, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn is made at leſs than half the Expence; and when Commodities are cheap, then is Money dear or ſcarce, becauſe there muſt be a great deal of Goods in Exchange for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Money; as on the contrary, when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are dear then is Money cheap, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a little Ware will purchaſe a great deal of Money: And certain it is, that it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better for a Commonwealth, when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (which is the Blood of the Body-Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick) circulates quickly, and is diſtributed through all the Parts, than when it ſtagnates or lies dead in a few Mens Hands, whilſt Commerce, and all the Buſineſs of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, ſhall be at a Stand by too much Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which muſt needs occaſion a Stoppage of Money: For, to ſpeak truly, none reap the Benefit of Plenty but the poorer ſort of People, nor do they truly; for ſo it is, that in the Years of Plenty, Workmen are hardeſt to be procur'd, and thoſe moſt exacting too, becauſe a few Days Labour will maintain them
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47781:41"/>
a great while. The Plenty does but tempt them to Lazineſs and Riot, which in the end leads them into Miſery, and becomes expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and burthenſome to the Publick; ſo that 'twill be ſtill better that the Market ſhould be quick, (and quick it will be when Proviſions are ſcarce,) than to have it over-glutted, which cannot but diſcourage Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as it will certainly encourage Sloth and Beggery.</p>
               <p>What I ſpeak as to Scarcity, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a moderate meaſure; for if it tend to Dearth, it cannot but be very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and grievous to all ſorts of People: So that how great a Bleſſing ſoever Plenty may be thought, certain 'tis that it does diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Men to Intemperance and Exceſs, and is then only to be look'd upon as a Bleſſing, when what is ſuperfluous may be exported abroad, and bring us home ſuch things as we ſtand in need of. And as to the Productions of what we are now diſcourſing, 'tis no leſs certain that they endamage the Publick in many other reſpects, it being known to every one, that the Fleſh of Sheep or Cattle, fatted by ſuch ſorts of Graſs, is fady, worſe colour'd and worſe taſted than what is Graſs-fed; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the white Meat, or the Cheeſe and Butter made of ſuch Paſturage.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe and ſuch-like Conſiderations we may affirm, ſecurely, that as it is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſo is it in the Power of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to baniſh theſe Foreign Productions,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47781:42"/>
becauſe detrimental to the greater part of the Nation; or, if continu'd, 'twould be much for its Intereſt to impoſe a Duty, as a Crown for the purpoſe, yearly, upon every Acre ſo planted; which would be ſome Help towards defraying the Publick Charge, and leave the Planters or Husbandmen ſufficient Gainers by the Bargain. 'Tis the Duty of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate not to debar any from their Rights and Liberty, but by all due Proviſions to ſupport them in the ſame. But when the Intereſt of Particular Perſons ſhall ſtand in Competition with that of a greater Body, (as it is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated that it does in the preſent Caſe,) 'tis certainly in his Power to reduce them into their former Methods of living, and not ſuffer them to injure a greater Body by new Projects tending to their Private Intereſt. Nor is this to abridge Men of their Rights, but to confine them to their preſent State and Condition of Life, upon Conſiderations of a more General Good.</p>
               <p>Nor does this, which is now deliver'd, any way prejudice or contradict the Deſign of an after-Eſſay, as to the Buſineſs of excluding Sea-coal from the City of <hi>London;</hi> becauſe, in that caſe, the Change is ſuppos'd to be of infinite more Advantage to the City, (and in a manner to the whole Kingdom,) than the Continuance; and tho' ſome Perſons may be prejadic'd in their Intereſts, yet is their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber very inconſiderable, compar'd with thoſe who ſhall be better'd by the Change: Nor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47781:42"/>
can they be ſo great Loſers by the Bargain as the Graſiers and the Paſture-Men of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially in thoſe Parts where ſuch Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Productions are found to grow.</p>
               <p>To conclude this little Diſpute: There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more competent Judge in the preſent Queſtion than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation it ſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in its Parliaments, particularly in that Proviſion which they have made former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle. 'Tis very well known, that after the Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in that Kingdom, Thouſands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families were encourag'd by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then in being, to remove Themſelves and Subſtance, and to ſettle there, as it were in form of a Colony, in order to Re-people that almoſt ruin'd and abandon'd Iſland: And becauſe the Country was moſt proper for the breeding of Cattle, they began ſoon to take root, ſending over vaſt Droves into <hi>England,</hi> and driving a very conſiderable Trade amongſt their Friends and Correſpondents, the Effect of which being found very prejudicial to this Nation, and to ſuch eſpecially whoſe chiefeſt Revenue depended likewiſe upon the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cattle. The Parliament, I ſay, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Markets every where to ſink, and the Farmers likewiſe to be unable to pay their Rent, as being depriv'd of the Means of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Money, and conſequently that Land-Taxes (the common Expedient to which the Nation has recourſe) would become very uneaſie and heavy upon the Subject: They,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47781:43"/>
in their great Foreſight of the ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Liberty, thought fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite all farther Importations; and by this means enabled the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to hold up their Heads again, and bear their Burthens, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in their former Road of breeding Cattle, as in Ancient Times. Now if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament dealt thus with <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were their Fellow-Subjects under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, nay, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, and their Neighbours; for they were for the moſt part the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who carried on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle-Trade, and ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> too as had been drawn over into <hi>Ireland</hi> upon large Promiſes of Favour and Aſſiſtance; I cannot ſee but that there is infinite greater Reaſon to reduce our Traders in Foreign Graſs, ſo much prejudicial to the Paſturage of this Kingdom; which Paſturage, I ſay, ſo much impoveriſh'd as it is, is ſtill forc'd to lie under the heavy Weight of Taxes, whilſt the new Planters, or Supplanters rather, who cauſe this ſo great a Decay of Paſturage, are at full Eaſe, and in the very Letter of the Country Proverb, <hi>lie fattening in Clover.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Commonage and Incloſures.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ANother Queſtion iſſuing from the former Diſcourſe, is about the Rights of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monage and Incloſures; where, in the firſt place, we are to underſtand, that the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, Whether the Supreme Authority hath a Power to uncommon waſt Grounds, when 'tis attended with Remarkable Benefit, (as in the Caſe of the waſt Grounds near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſhall be hereafter diſcours'd of?) for that I take to be indiſputable. The Queſtion then will be, firſt in General, Whether the Commoners, or the Proprietors, have the more Ancient Title? Secondly, Whether it would be more for the Intereſt of a Nation, that there ſhould be many wide Heaths and Commons, as now they are? or that all were inclos'd and improv'd to the utmoſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>I begin with the Firſt, concerning which the Dfficulty will not be great, it being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every one that in the firſt Ages of the World we rarely read of Incloſures. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties indeed they had of Servants and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and in the Number of theſe conſiſted their Wealth, but for Propriety of Land we meet
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47781:44"/>
with nothing ſaving thoſe Common Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Land-Marks, (which were Rivers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or Mountains) by which the Poſſeſſions of Nations, or greater Families were diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; which Families were not like thoſe of our Age, conſiſting of a Maſter, with his Wife, Children or Domeſticks; but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of thoſe days were a kind of little Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, where one preſided in Chief over the ſeveral Branches or Members depending on him, whether they deſcended from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or whether they were of a younger Houſe, comprehending in the account all Servants, with their Offspring; all Captives, and ſuch as were purchas'd with Money: So that a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily then might conſiſt of Several Hundreds of individual P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſons, and might be made up of divers ſubordinate and inferiour Families, all depending upon one common Head. This, as it is moſt obvious from all Profane Story, and more eſpecially from the Sacred Writings; ſo is it as plain too from the ſame Sacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Patriarchs liv'd for a long time, in Tents, <hi>wandring from place to place,</hi> as they found Conveniencies for feeding of their Cattle.</p>
               <p>We find indeed, that the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Two moſt ancient and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Monarchs of which we read; That they built them Cities with ſtately Walls, and other prodigious Piles which they left as Monuments of their Greatneſs to future Ages. 'Tis certain likewiſe, That there were many other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47781:44"/>
Cities, of which we read often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorroh.</hi> The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> alſo had Cities with Walls looking high towards Heaven; but all this while, there is no Proof of Encloſures of Paſturage, nor yet probably of Corn-Fields; for then there muſt have been diverſities of Farms or ſingle Houſes, as now there are: But of this we read nothing, only that Men liv'd ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſome kind of a Body, which is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but a City.</p>
               <p>As for Paſturage 'twas all in Common; but in regard that Corn not being rais'd but with Labour and Charge, 'tis probable that the Prince or Head of the Family or People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Burthen, appointing afterwards to every one of his Servants or Dependants his due Portion. But in after Ages, as Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to thirſt after Conqueſt, and many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions ariſing daily about the Diviſions of the Fruits of the Earth, 'twas thought Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that every Man's Propriety ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by particular Limits or Encloſures; which hapned frequently upon a Conqueſt, where the Services of private Perſons were rewarded by the Conquerors aſſigning out of the Lands of the Vanquiſhed Country, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain portion of Ground to every man, as his Service might deſerve.</p>
               <p>This was the Caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> upon their Entrance into <hi>Canaan;</hi> and ours likewiſe in <hi>England,</hi> upon the <hi>Norman</hi> Invaſion, as alſo of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſometimes, unleſs thoſe whom
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47781:45"/>
they ſubdu'd became Tributaries; tho gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, the <hi>Romans</hi> dealing bountifully with the conquer'd Nations, did naturalize or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate them amongſt their Citizens, which Clemency of theirs rais'd that Empire to its Greatneſs, few caring to reſiſt ſuch Generous and Potent Enemies, who were ſo eaſie to be entreated, ſo faithful to their Allies, and ſo able and reſolute to protect thoſe who ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them.</p>
               <p>But to return to my Argument, From what has been hinted 'tis unqueſtionable, That the Rights and Title of Commonage are much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter than thoſe of Encloſures; I mean, in the general; and with us here in <hi>England,</hi> the Rights of our preſent Commoners ſeem to have begun upon the Conqueſt, when King <hi>William</hi> and his Succeſſors, reſerving to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves certain Lands for Foreſts and Chaces, and for the Preſervation of Game, the Inhabitants bordering upon ſuch Places, under ſome Fines of acknowledgment or Vaſſalage were allow'd the Priviledge of keeping Cattle on them, with ſome other Advantages, the Kings ſtill retaining to themſelves the Royalty or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſuch Places for the Preſervation of Deer, and for their own Sport and Recreation. The like Conſtitution hereunto we may obſerve in other Manors or Lordſhips, deriv'd at firſt from the Crown; ſo that the Commoners Title, in this reſpect, precedes that of any Proprietor; Foraſmuch as the whole Kingdom then, tho' beautified with Cities, and divided into Farms,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47781:45"/>
as at this preſent day, was to be reputed but as One Great Common, out of which many private Perſons were permitted to buy; or of the Royal Bounty and Grant, to appropriate ſome Parts or Parcels of it, under the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of certain Duties or Acts of Homage, all which Priviledges being confirmed by after Acts of Parliament, do inveſt the Commoners with ſuch a Right or Title as nothing but a Parliamentary Power can reverſe.</p>
               <p>The next Quaere then is this, <hi>Whether it would be more for the Intereſt of a Nation that there ſhould be many wide Heaths and Commons as now there are; Or that all ſhould be inclos'd and improv'd to the utmoſt Value?</hi> Here I muſt confeſs a Field lies open for a large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; all that I ſhall adventure in it, ſhall be to propoſe ſuch Reaſons as may occur on one hand, and on the other, leaving the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Controverſie to the Reader's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, it may be urg'd in favour of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures; That by this means many Families would live creditably and in good Faſhion from the Profits to be made hereby; and that ſuch Profits would be a very great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Spur to Induſtry, as the Fruits and Productions reapt from ſuch Encloſures would be of great Advantage to the Publick, by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Markets with more plentiful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, whether of Corn or Cattle; which New-Encloſed Farms likewiſe being improv'd; upon a Survey and Eſtimate made of them,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47781:46"/>
would be a great Eaſe to the Nation in time of War, by being made to partake and ſhare of the Common Burthen in the Supplies uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally required on ſuch Occaſions; whereas in the State and Condition wherein Commons lie at preſent, the Publick is damnified, ſuch Places being generally Seminaries of a lazy, Thieving ſort of People: For what Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can there be for Induſtry and Labour, when thoſe who take no Pains ſhall ſhare in the Profit? ſuch People likewiſe being remote from Neighbours of Reputation and Fortune, may be accounted for Heathens and Savages, living in a manner without all Knowledge of God; there being little Encouragement for able Miniſters from a lean and hungry Soil, ſo that living remote from Churches, and no Officers or Magiſtrates being near them, they ſeem to be a Brood of <hi>Terrae-Filii,</hi> or law leſs Rogues, engendring upon one another as from the beginning, ſo on to the end of the World, and preſerving themſelves frequently from ſtarving, by ſtealing of Wood, Sheep, and Cattle, and by breaking of Houſes, to the great Annoyance of all honeſt Husbandmen who have the misfortune to live near them.</p>
               <p>And as the Men, ſo are the Cattle, which are bred upon ſuch Commons, being a ſtarv'd, ſcabby and raſcally Race. Their Sheep are poor, tatter'd and poyſon'd with the Rot. Their Cattle and Colts dwarft and ragged: For little, beggarly Stone-Colts, running pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly amongſt the Herd, beget a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47781:46"/>
ſhotten and Baſtardly Breed; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally 'tis that Horſes nabb upon ſuch wild and deſert Places, half famiſhed; by which means the Race of our Horſes becomes taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and baſe; whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe when he comes of a good Kind, and being careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lookt to when a Colt, may be eſteem'd the beſt, perhaps, in the World; I mean, for all the uſes of a Horſe, whether for drudging and fatigue, or for the Pad: Our better ſort of Horſes being generally ſwift and eaſie Goers, and fit for the Chace, and for Running, as well as for the Road. Foreign Countries indeed, yield better Horſes for ſome particular uſes, as the <hi>Low Countries</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> for the Draught and Coach; <hi>Naples</hi> for the Great Saddle; <hi>Barbary</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> for Shape and Fleetneſs: But the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in more reſpects than one, where the Breed, I ſay, is not poyſon'd by Commons. Upon which account it is that our Hackneys are ſo much eſteemed Beyond-Sea. Nor are Commons only injurious to the Race of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but alſo of Cattle, The increaſe of ſuch Places being nothing but a ſort of ſtarv'd, Tod-bellied Runts, neither fit for the Dairy nor the Yoke; ſo that a Common, upon the matter, is nothing but a Naked Theater of Poverty, both as to Men and Beaſts, where all things appear horrid and uncultivated, and may be term'd, not improperly, the very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of Degenerated Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:47781:47"/>
But notwithſtanding all this, much may be ſaid on the behalf of Commons; as firſt, that they are more productive of People: For a Common, or Waſte of ſix hundred Acres will maintain thirty Cottages of Four to a Family, which if inclos'd would not amount to above Eight Farms, each Farm containing about ſeven Perſons one with another. Now, 'tis for the Intereſt of a Nation, that it ſhould abound rather with Men than Cattle; and that ſuch Men are poor, matters not, ſo they be not indigent, or ſuch as ſtand in need of Relief from the Pariſh. For were it not for theſe poor Labourers, the Rich themſelves would ſoon become poor; for either they muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Till the Ground themſelves, or ſuffer it to ly waſte, and in the end Common. Now ſuch poor Cottages being inur'd to all manner of Hardſhips, prove excellent good Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where they are kept in order; and as they are exceeding ſerviceable for the Country Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Times of Peace, ſo are they moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Time of War, for the ſame reaſon of being bred hardy, and when reform'd by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline will make good rough, croſs-grain'd Soldiers enough, fit to kill or be kill'd. This we ſee exemplified in <hi>Switzerland, Sweden</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which as they are the pooreſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſo do they yield the braveſt Soldiers in the World. Whereas the Commonwealths which are rich and Traffick are no way conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable upon this ſcore, their Men generally being foggy and reſty. <hi>Spain,</hi> 'tis true, is in the

main a poor Country, and yet in no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for Martial Men, as heretofore, their Great Ones, which ſhould make Officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men too much abandon'd to Pleaſures, and if the meaner ſort of them make not their Fortunes this way, 'tis to be imputed to the Genius of the People, who being naturally proud and haughty, will rather ſtarve like Dons, than take pains like Men.</p>
               <p>But this Conſideration poſſibly, might be of greater Moment under a Government which thirſts after the Enlargement of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, than in a Monarchy, ſuch as the <hi>Britiſh</hi> is, whoſe Empire being Inſular, it can never be its Intereſt, unleſs by way of Diverſion, to make a War upon the Continent, where ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Invaſions cannot be made, in which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally conſiſts the Succeſs of ſuch Wars; and for Invaſions or Tranſportations of Armies, they are things of vaſt Expence, Embarraſs and Noiſe, and ſubject to many fatal Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from the Winds and Weather, or the Reſiſtance which may be made by the Enemy, and other Difficulties in Landing. But let us ſuppoſe the Aggreſſors be ſo fortunate as to ſet footing upon the Continent, they could not expect long to keep Poſſeſſion, unleſs they were certain to have their Allies, the Seas, the Winds, and a vaſt Treaſure always at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and to be able to ſend Recruits as quick as we can Letters by the next Return of the Pacquet-Boat. Nevertheleſs, in a Defenſive or Civil War, ſuch hardy Rogues as are bred
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47781:48"/>
uſually upon Commons, may prove excellent good Food for Powder.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, 'tis true that ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners or Cottagers are generally Savage and Paganiſh: If honeſt Miniſters were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to over-ſee theſe Goats, ſome ſmall good poſſibly might be done; but much more might be expected from a vigilant and ſevere Juſtice of the Peace, taking in to his Aſſiſtance ſome Conſtables of the like Mettle: For we are not now to expect Miracles in the Converſion of ſuch Heathens by Preaching; a good ſtrong pair of Stocks, and a Whipping-poſt, will work a greater Reformation than Forty Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Uſes. Nor truly will the Paſtors themſelves much care to be troubled with ſuch an unregenerate and barren Flock, which will yield neither Milk nor Cloathing. However the Matter ſtands, the Fault is not ſo much in the Men, but ſomething alſo in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and more in the Circumſtances of theſe uncultivated Places, which naturally incline Men to Barbarity and Ignorance.</p>
               <p>As for the Sterility of Commons, ſomething might be ſaid againſt it, were we ſure to have a good Utterance for the Fruits of ſuch new Improvements: But, as the Caſe now ſtands, we want rather Men to be fed, than Meat to feed them; and where there is Plenty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, if there be not Wealth proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, 'twill quickly cloy, or turn to Surfeit. For Men may be poor, that is, without a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their Purſes, in the midſt of full Crops
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47781:48"/>
and Herds of Cattle; ſince we are not in the Primitive Golden Age of the World, when that Metal was leaſt in Requeſt, and when all things were procur'd by Barter or Trucking; but rather in the Silver one, where whatſoever we ſtand in need of can no otherways be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd but by the Divinity of Money.</p>
               <p>The Horſes which are bred upon ſuch Commons muſt be confeſs'd likewiſe to be ſhriveling and grubbiſh, but withal, being hardy, they are fit for all ſorts of meaner Drudgery, to which better Fleſh might not willingly be expos'd: So that if two of theſe little Garrans go to the making up of one tolerable Horſe, there is no greater Loſs than for a Man to have two Six Pences inſtead of one Shilling, which, as they are of equal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, ſo are the leſſer Pieces more uſeful for Change and Barter: And he who gains his Livelihood by the Labour of ſuch cheap Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, if one of them come to a Miſchance, the Loſs is not great; whereas the Death of one good Horſe would be the utter Ruine perhaps of a poor Man's Family.</p>
               <p>And although our Cottagers are found ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to be too lazy, and void of Morality, yet we may obſerve, that there is rarely any one of theſe Huts or Cabins, but has its little Incloſures lying round about it: As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a pretty Plot of Ground like a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, from whence he mows a Modicum of Hay, to keep his Cow, or a few Sheep, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Injuries of the Winter; as likewiſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47781:49"/>
a little Rib of Tillage for Bread-Corn, or perhaps a ſlender Orchard, or ſome other Plantation of Trees, to ſhelter him from the Extremities of the Weather; ſo that every ſuch Cottage ſeems to be an Epitome of a more Voluminous Farm, which is ſo much the more pleaſant to the Eye, not of the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I mean, but of the Spectators, by how much the Variety of the Landskip is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into a leſſer compaſs. And I have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtood and paus'd a while in viewing theſe Rural Manſions, conſidering with my ſelf, within how ſmall a Circle the familiar Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the moſt innocent Delights of the Earth may be confin'd, and how little may ſuffice to relieve the Neceſſities of Nature.</p>
               <p>As for the Suppreſſing of Cottages, as it would be unpolitick, ſo would it be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, without a due Regard firſt had for the Maintenance of the Inhabitants, (which would be no Injury, but a Benefit to ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,) who having liv'd Time immemorial in ſuch Places, they have as good a Title to their Habitations, as if they had continu'd there from the Beginning of the World. I know, in Caſes of a General Neceſſity, the Rights of Particular Perſons may be impeach'd, for the Preventing of a greater Evil, as it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to blow up a Houſe (without the Owners Leave) to prevent a Conflagration; or in caſe a Ship be ready to ſink, 'tis lawful likewiſe to caſt a Private Perſon's Goods into the Sea, to lighten the Burthen: But this only holds good

then when a particular Man's Concerns is ſo twiſted with that of others, that all muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſink or ſwim together. But to invade any Man's Private Intereſt without his Leave, or due Compenſation had for his Loſs, and for the Benefit purely of others, wherein the Loſer himſelf is not concern'd, this is againſt Reaſon; ſo that we are carefully to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between a Neceſſity and a Convenience. In Caſes, I ſay, of Common Neceſſity, 'tis better a Part than a Whole ſhould ſuffer; but in Caſes of Convenience 'tis not ſo: For no Man ought to ſuffer for the Advantage of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when the Perſon ſuffering partakes not of that Advantage.</p>
               <p>Where, by the way, we may take leave to glance a little at the Behaviour of ſome Lords of Mannors, whoſe Bailiffs many times whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the Cottages, (as depending perhaps upon his Lordſhip for their Imployments,) allowing them Liberty to build upon the Waſt, and to incloſe Ground, perhaps; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a Tree or two to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, upon Condition they will take a Leaſe of ſuch Cottages for Three Lives, paying only ſome Six Penny chief Rent: Upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of which Term, his hungery Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſwallows the poor Cottage, with all its Members and Dependencies, at a bit, which by the Sweat and Labour of the poor Defunct and his Predeceſſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By which ſly Methods the Commonage will be engroſs'd in Time, and many whole Families be devour'd, to ſerve the Appetite of an unſatiable Patron: A Thing to which the Parliament of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to have a ſpecial Regard, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers whereof, many of them, tho Lords of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, yet is it to be hop'd that they will act like Men of Truſt and Honour, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Frauds, attended with ſo much Inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how conducible ſoever they may ſeem to their private Intereſts, to go without Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Coppice-Wood.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Third General Thing about which the good Husbandman muſt be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, is <hi>Planting:</hi> To which I ſhall ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Particulars. Firſt, of <hi>Woods</hi> or <hi>Coppices;</hi> next, of <hi>Trees uſeful for Husbandry;</hi> and laſtly, of <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In planting of a Coppice great Care ought to be had to the Situation of the Ground: The Ground then ought to be a little riſing to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> for that is held the beſt for Timber; and all Under-wood likewiſe thrives beſt the more 'tis expos'd to the Riſing-Sun. It is no way profitable to ſuffer Timber-Trees to grow in Coppice-Woods, unleſs on the skirts or out-ſides, where they may ſpread their Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without Injury to the Coppice, and receive the Benefit of the Sun; but where they grow amidſt the Coppice they hurt one another: For if Timber-Trees be lopp'd, they grow knotty and bare; and if unlopp'd, the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of the Boughs will ſpoil the Growth of the Coppice after a Fellet, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood likewiſe will rob the Timber-Trees of its Nouriſhment, and by this means they will extreamly injure one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:47781:51"/>
In cutting of a Coppice, if the Shoots be old, 'tis beſt to pare em cloſe to the Ground, for the young Shoots will come up more thick and ſtrong. The Poles, after they be ſtript, if they be left ſtanding a Year, will grow tough and hard at the Heart, and be never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Worm. The ſame Benefit may be procur'd by cutting them down as ſoon as they be ſtript, and caſting them into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where they may ly for ſome time, and then taken out for uſe, as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. It is very ill Husbandry to ſuffer Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to go into Coppice-Woods: Nevertheleſs, after they be of Seven or Eight Years growth, Colts may feed upon the Lawnes or Walks of ſuch Woods, without any great Dammage.</p>
               <p>I hold Aſh to be very profitable in Coppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for they will ſhoot up in heighth, and grow very ſtreight, and make excellent Hoops, beſides, it is a quick Grower. I hold it very profitable likewiſe, where a Coppice is to be raiſed by ſetting of Acorns, to ſow Crab-Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels amongſt them; for they will be rais'd much ſafer this way than in a Nurſery, and may be remov'd without any injury to the Coppice, as occaſion ſhall require: What is pretended, that ſuch Stocks when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved or re-planted in an open place will not thrive, as being remov'd out of a warm Bed into the open Air, is a meer Fancy: For I have known ſuch Stocks as forward as any, and altho the <hi>Coppice-wood</hi> might ſhelter them from the cold Winds, yet 'tis certain, that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47781:51"/>
much more in the Root, which is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſpread it ſelf far, being choakt up by the crowd of other Roots about them, which alſo rob them of their due Nouriſhment, ſo that when they are tranſlated from their hungry Soil, and their devouring Neighbours and Thickets, they will quickly flouriſh, and be more hardy than thoſe which are raiſed in the Nurſery.</p>
               <p>Diſcourſing once with a Gentleman, (Mr. <hi>Seale</hi> of <hi>Cotton <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderidge</hi> in the County of <hi>Gloster)</hi> who was very Curious and Intelligent in theſe Matters, and of whatſoever related to Husbandry, he made it out, That an Acre of <hi>Coppice-Wood</hi> on a Plain, might contain as much Wood as two Acres on the ſide of a Hill, tho that on the Plain, as likewiſe the Ground on the ſide of the Hill, might ſeem both alike planted, or equally thick in appearance; which Aſſertion, tho it looks at firſt like a Paradox, contains a real Truth, as he made appear from this Pyramidal or Triangular Figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> the Baſis, repreſents the Plain. <hi>B B</hi> the two ſides of the Triangular, repreſent the ſides
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47781:52"/>
of the Hill or Mountain. <hi>C C C C</hi> Shew the Trees ſhooting from the Plain, and from the ſides: For if we conſider the matter a little, and the Order wherein Trees grow upon a Plain, and upon a hanging Surface, we ſhall find them perfectly ſtretching themſelves in ſuch Order as the Figure repreſents: So that if the Hill or Mountain be very high and ſteep, one Acre at the bottom may contain four times the quantity of Wood, as an Acre on the ſide of a Hill, a thing which all who deal in Woods, ought to have regard to.</p>
               <p>A Plantation of <hi>Coppice-wood</hi> is a thing of great Profit; for by this means, Ground which is not worth five Shillings an Acre, will be worth Twenty, and better. 'Tis true, it will be 18 or 20 Years before we come to reap the fruit of our labour, which may diſcourage thoſe perhaps, who are advanc'd in Years, from entring upon a Project, of which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they may never ſee the effect. But Men are not born only for themſelves, but muſt be mindful alſo of Poſterity whether deſcending from themſelves, or ſuch as ſhall riſe up in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages. And certain it is, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which ſhall accrue this way, as it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo it is more laudable than what may ariſe from the Returns of a long ſleeping Mortgage. And there is further advantage in <hi>Copoices</hi> or Woods, above other Lands, that they are not ſubject to ſink in their Value or encumber us, as Tillage and Paſture, which ſometimes for want of Tenants, ſometimes by the Fall of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47781:52"/>
Cattle, or Corn, or ſome Accident or other, become very hazardous and troubleſome, and require continual Expence to maintain them: Whereas <hi>Coppice-Woods</hi> being a little lookt to, and preſerv'd from Cattle for ſome time after they be cut, there is no more trouble with them; and we reap the Profit of them in a good round Sum, or in Groſs; whereas other Lands make their Returns by little and little, and as it were by Retail, ſo that Money melts away inſenſibly, or in trifling ſervices, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps.</p>
               <p>Further yet, A Plantation of <hi>Coppice-Wood,</hi> as it is moſt profitable to a private Undertaker, ſo is it moſt pleaſant and ornamental, if near a Gentleman's Houſe. If it be ſeated therefore on the ſide of a Hill, I hold it very beautiful and graceful to Plant a <hi>Coppice</hi> on the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ground leading to it, and ſo to cut Glades or Avenues which may give a View and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Seat; which Roads or Walks, if well kept, and regularly cut, are far more grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than Rows of Trees, where the failing of ſome here and there, make a great Gap in the Walk, of which there is no danger in thick Tufts of Wood; and beſides the Pleaſure of the Shades, ſuch places are more delightful from the Birds and Game with which they may be ſtor'd. Such Gentlemen therefore who build for Pleaſure, ought to have regard to this particular; as alſo, to have Springs or little Currents lying about their Houſes, which may ſerve for Uſe and Ornament: Of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:47781:53"/>
Hitherto I have ſpoken a little of planting Wood, with regard only to the private Intereſts and the Profit of the Planter; but in reſpect of the <hi>Publick,</hi> the Advantage cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is much more conſiderable which hence ariſes: For it is by ſuch Plantations that our Arſenals are, from Age to Age, ſtor'd with Ship-Timber, and conſequently the beſt Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Defence of the Nation depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: So that the Decay of Timber in an Age where there is twice the Occaſion for it as formerly, cannot but portend una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Danger for the future, if due regard be not had hereunto. And truly, upon the Dreadful Fire of <hi>London,</hi> had not <hi>Norway, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> furniſh'd us with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Materials for its Repair, there would hardly have been any good Timber-Building left in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Another thing which ſeems very much to render good Timber ſcarce, eſpecially Oak, was the ſevere Froſt in 83, which made Gaps in infinite Numbers of them, by which they are become ſeedy or ſhatter'd, and unfit for Plank, and all better Uſes; whilſt others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſuch a cheque or ſtop as they will not recover for ſome Years; nor indeed, be ever ſo thrifty as before; ſo that from that time to this, we find all ſorts of Timber growing ſcarcer and dearer, and ſo 'tis likely ſtill to continue. 'Tis well we are in good Terms with the <hi>Northern</hi> Crowns; but ſhould we once have a Difference with them, we might
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47781:53"/>
ſoon expect to be brought to the utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; eſpecially when the Iron-works (thoſe great Devourers of Fewel) ſhould mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply upon us, to furniſh the Kingdom with ſuch Iron-Proviſions and Stores as are now brought from thence, and all but little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſerve our Occaſions: So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a general Slaughter, or rather Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of Wood, as would be made in ſuch a Conjuncture, we could not but become an eaſie Prey to a Foreign Invaſion. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves therefore our Parliaments, more than ever, to put a ſtop to ſuch Practices as ſhall unduly diminiſh the Growth of ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Commodity, as alſo to encourage the planting of it by ſome Priviledges and Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and particularly, to encourage the planting of Wood in ſuch Heaths and barren Grounds as lie commodious to any Navigable River, or near ſuch Ports and Harbours to which our Shipping does moſt reſort.</p>
               <p>But of things relating to this Subject, more at large, when I ſhall hereafter diſcourſe of the Fuel of <hi>London.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>EVERY Husbandman or Farmer, tho he be not Maſter of a Park, or of Fair Woods, ought to have his. Ground well ſtord with ſuch Trees as may promote his Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, ſuch as Elms, Oak and Aſh; as likewiſe, to be commodiouſly furniſh'd with Aqualicks, or ſuch as grow near the Brooks and Waters, as Sally, Withy and Orles: For theſe Trees, tho of leſs bulk, are very ſerviceable. And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, I begin with Elms: Elms then, as alſo Poplar, being cut at the Butt, do Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice or caſt forth New Shoots in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; ſo that ſo far as their Roots ſpread under Ground, they will ſprout out of the Earth like a little Forreſt; For there being no Branches to draw the Sap, the Roots caſt forth (or diſcharge themſelves of) what may be ſpared from the main Tree towards the raiſing a new Offspring: Theſe young Plants, if preſerv'd from the injury of Cattle, will grow conſiderably, but not to ſubſtance, by reaſon of their great Multitude: The more therefore of theſe young Sprouts are wed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47781:54"/>
away, the fairer will be the remainder: They are better therefore propagated this way than by Tranſplantation; tho if tranſplanted, the beſt way is to mow Graſs or Weeds, and lay them about the Roots, which will keep the Ground moiſt, ſweating, and defend the Roots from the Extremities of Heat and Cold; if ſome Stones be mixt with the Graſs it is not amiſs; for they will keep the Graſs hollow, and preſerve it from withering and baking together. The like helps may be us'd to preſerve Fruit-Trees, or any other Trees whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Elms in Husbandry are uſeful for Stocks and Valleys for Wheels; For Ox-Bows, as alſo for Harrows: This Wood likewiſe is good in Railes and Gates, if ſawn thin, not being apt to rove like Oak, and being light, will ſhut and open with more eaſe. Boards of Elm are good likewiſe for Floors and Doors of Rooms, but not ſo good as Oak, becauſe ſubject to ſwell and ſhrink upon alteration of Weather. The Seaſon of cutting them, is from <hi>Allhallon-tide</hi> to <hi>Candlemas;</hi> but if cut in the Summer, let them be caſt into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a quarter of a Year, and that will fetch out the Sap, and preſerve them from the Worms.</p>
               <p>An old Barr-Oak being cut at the Butt will never Coppice more; but Saplings or young Timber will ſhoot from the Butt, but not ſprout forth of the Ground, round about, like Elm and Poplar. Oaks therefore, are beſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47781:55"/>
rais'd of Acorns, eſpecially in large Fields: For if Acorns be ſet in a ſmall quantity, they will be in danger of being deſtroy'd by Moles, or Field-Mice, who are of a ſtrange quick Scent, and will get them out of the Ground, tho never ſo well cover'd, and carry them to their little Holds or Store-Houſes.</p>
               <p>Oaks, tho they be accounted the longeſt Livers amongſt the Trees of this Iſland, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſooneſt by Cold and Drought of any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Poplar and Aſp, as was obſervable in 84, being the Year following that ſevere Froſt. A vaſt number of Oaks, eſpecially the old ones, wither'd away the following Summer, which prov'd exceeding dry. And of ſound Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Trees many were ſplit and cleft to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart, ſo that a Man might put his Finger in the Cleft or Rent, which clos'd up again when the Froſt was over; and altho they ſeem'd to the Eye to have receiv'd no Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, yet 'tis certain that they were ſeely, or weeping or ſhatter'd, and in a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable being ſawn. For tho the Gaps and Clefts which were made by the Froſt heal'd up again, leaving ſometimes no Seam nor Scar in outward appearance; nevertheleſs, when ſuch Trees are cut, the Wounds will ſoon appear; ſo that the Dammage done that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I have ſaid before, will not be repair'd in many Ages; and I look upon good Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be a Commodity which will every day grow more ſcarce than other. And ſuch tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the violence of that Froſt, that as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47781:55"/>
I very well remember, it rent a Stone-Wall from the top to the bottom ſo wide, that I could lay my Finger in the Cleft, the Crack running and turning with the joints of the Stones, which Breach at Spring clos'd up again, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no mark of Rupture behind. The Wall was built upon a Rocky Foundation in the Water. Of all Trees Elms reſiſt Cold the beſt, for I obſerv'd not one to periſh by that rigid Seaſon.</p>
               <p>Oak ſerves for ſeveral Uſes in Husbandry, as for Planks and Beds for Waines, for Spokes in Wheels, for Veſſel-Staves, and for all the Occaſions of Building; 'tis the Wood which is moſt durable and beautiful. If you caſt Beeches or Quarter-Wood into the Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſawn Green, and letting them lie therein a quarter of a Year, and better, 'twill fetch out the Sap, and make them fit for Uſe quickly. Likewiſe Saplings being caſt green into the Water, after they have lain there for ſome time, become tough and hard, and will not be ſubject to Worms, as appears by Axle-Trees; ſo that a Gate or Rails made of young Poles thus ſeaſon'd, ſhall laſt many Years, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſubject to the Worm, nor to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oaks, Elms, and generally all Trees what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, being cropp'd, or having the Heads cut off, ſo that they cannot ſtretch themſelves higher, grow more bulky and burry; ſo that 'tis uſual for an Oak, thus dwarf'd, to contain ſix Yards in compaſs: For ſuch Trees rotting and periſhing at the Heart, by reaſon of the Wet which ſoaks in perpetually at the Head, Nature enlarges them, and endeavours to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out their juſt Period of Duration by wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening their ſides; ſo that what would have been ſpent otherwiſe in the Nouriſhment of great Limbs and Branches, is expended whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Trunk: And ſo deſirous are Trees of living, (I mean in reſpect of their Natural Inclinations,) that they will ſtill preſerve themſelves in their vegetative Station, till all the Heart and Timber within be rotted, there remaining perhaps nothing of them almoſt, but the very Shell or outward Bark.</p>
               <p>Although Oaks be eſteem'd with us as Trees of great bulk, yet are they far ſhort of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, or of the Firr, of which I remember to have ſeen on the Wharf, where the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> and the <hi>Soan</hi> meet, at <hi>Lyons,</hi> Firr-Trees ſquar'd full thirty Yards or Paces in length, being at the Butt near upon three Foot ſquare, and a Foot and a half near the ſmall End. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, Oaks has the Preheminence of theſe and all other Trees whatſoever, as being more durable after cutting, and more ſerviceable in all Reſpects; and even for Shipping, Maſts only excepted, they are known by daily Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

to withſtand the Batteries of Great Guns much better than any other Wood whatſoever, being not ſubject to ſplintering, like Firr; tho' perhaps the Firr, as being a lighter Wood, may be better for ſailing; but this muſt be underſtood then of Ketches, or leſſer Frigates, ſuch as <hi>Corſairs</hi> uſe, and not of great Ships fit for fighting and more eminent Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſhes</hi> are beſt rais'd from Keys ſown or planted in a Nurſery: They are not liable to the Danger of Field-Mice; and one Aſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted from a Nurſery, ſhall grow more in two Years, than another of the ſame bigneſs taken from a Hedge or Coppice ſhall in ten; becauſe thoſe in Nurſeries are better rooted. Theſe Keys of Aſhes will be in the Ground full two Springs before they will peep forth, and muſt be wed a little the firſt Year, and dug a little too, if it may be done without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, tho' it be with a How or the point of a Trovel.</p>
               <p>Aſh in Husbandry ſerves for Spittle or Spade-Trees, for Drocks and Spindles for Plows, for Hoops, for Helves, and Staves, for all Tools of Husbandry, as being tough, ſmooth, and light. Aſh growing in Hedges, ought often to be cropp'd; for it grows to a head ſooner than any Tree, and is the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fir-wood of any, being fit to burn as ſoon as cleft or cut. Beſides, tall Aſhes being ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Wind, caſt the Rain or Dew which fall upon them, a great way upon the Ground; nor is there any thing ſo miſchievous to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47781:57"/>
Graſs or Corn as the Dropping of an Aſh.</p>
               <p>Beech, by reaſon of the ſtraitneſs and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Wood, is ſerviceable in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, particularly to Wheel-wrights, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Joiners, and is uſeful enough for building, in ſeveral reſpects; but that which gives it the greater Reputation, is, that it grows in the pooreſt and moſt barren Ground, if it be ſtony and mountainous; ſo that the Ground, commonly, where they thrive beſt, is on the ſide of a ſtony, rocky Hill, which otherwiſe would not be worth half a Crown an Acre. Of all Trees almoſt 'tis held the moſt beautiful, for the Freſhneſs of its Green, for the Straitneſs of its Trunk; and where they grow, they kill all tender Shrubs and Brambles, by drawing all the Nouriſhment of the Earth to themſelves, and yield therefore a moſt delightful Shade, and moſt fit for Walks. Hence it is that almoſt all Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Private Houſes in <hi>France</hi> plant little Walks of them in their Gardens.</p>
               <p>In lopping of Trees, 'tis very ill Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry to do like ſome lazy Workmen, who, when they are to repair a Hedge, cut one Stake here and another there, from a Tree, as it lies convenient for their Work; for by this means the Shot or Stub is kill'd by the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the over-hanging Boughs, and the Tree decays, and will in a ſhort time die, as we ſee in Trees which are half lopp'd, which at the beſt, ſend ſorth but poor ſtarv'd Shoots. Let the Tree therefore be cropp'd in the Winter-Seaſon,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47781:57"/>
and all together, and it will ſhoot with a very luſty Head, and in a ſhort time yield a large Crop. The Over-hangings like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of a Hedge, or of any other Tree, is very fatal to one newly cropp'd, by caſting always ſtained Water upon it, which in a ſhort time will poiſon the tender Shoots, and kill the Trunk.</p>
               <p>Some, in cropping or lopping of Trees, leave the Stub long, to preſerve the Timber from Knots; but 'tis obſerv'd, that ſuch Stubs, after two or three Years, will wither and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay; or, if not, they will hardly grow forth to yield a ſecond Crop: But in this Point let every Man follow his own Obſervation. Aſp ought to be lopp'd with great Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion; for if the top be cut off, 'twill die infallibly. There muſt ſome Branches be left, and that too in a conſiderable quantity, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Trunk; but in caſe it die, we may be ſure, I ſay, of a whole Forreſt round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the wither'd Trunk, which in due Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be tranſplanted; tho' ſuch young Trees are ſomething hazardous.</p>
               <p>Amongſt Aqualicks, or Trees which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to grow near the Water, Sally is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as any can be planted, and it is rais'd of Stakes or Settings. It thrives almoſt in all Soils, and is a very quick grower, and is moſt uſeful to make Buckles for Thatch, as alſo for Edderings or Lays, to bind the heads of Stakes in Hedges. They may be cropp'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry third Year, and an indifferent Tree every
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47781:58"/>
Lopping will yield half a Dray full of Wood of Tynnel; ſo that once in three Years every ſuch Tree ſhall yield ſo much Crop as ſhall be worth half a Crown in ſuch Places where Wood bears any tolerable Price. We may plant a hundred ſuch Trees upon an Acre, without any great Injury to the Ground; ſo that in Places unfurniſh'd with Wood, a ſpot of Ground thus planted will quickly come to Perfection, and ſerve all the Occaſions of a Conſiderable Farm. Upon which Account, I have always thought a Plantation of Sally to be far more profitable than that of any Fruit-Trees whatſoever; conſidering the quicker and certain Growth of the one, and the long and hazardous Progreſs of the other, before it come to Profit.</p>
               <p>Withy is much more difficult to raiſe than Sally, and grows beſt near the Water, and in a fat Soil, and eſpecially in Meadows, and on the Banks of a Brook. It ſerves for the ſame Uſes as Sally. The young Twiggs alſo are very ſerviceable to Basket-makers, and for binding of Tuggs in Thatch. I have obſerv'd the Settlings of Withy to thrive for a Year or two, and then commonly they die, that ſide withering which is towards the South Sun; the Reaſon whereof I am yet to learn, unleſs it be from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Hole in which we plant a Setting being made by a ſharp, ſtrong Stake, it may ſo happen that the Setting not reaching the bottom of the Hole, may wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away for want of Earth to give it Root
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47781:58"/>
and Nouriſhment, by reaſon of that hollow Space which lies betwixt the Butt-end of the Setting and the bottom of the Hole, as the ſame Hollowneſs containing Water all the Winter, helps likewiſe to ſtarve the Root, being void of Earth to cheriſh it.</p>
               <p>Orles are great Growers where they like their Soil, which commonly is a boggy and marſhy Ground. They are raiſed by Seeds they ſay, by cutting young Poles, and laying or burying them in the Ground at length, and being well cover'd with Earth, they will ſhoot out in very great Abundance; and if they are ſtripp'd or bark'd, and let ſtand a Year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they will never be ſubject to the Worm, and are very uſeful for Rafting of Barns, as being ſtrait and light. They will make like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very handſome light Ladders, and where the Wood is grown to any Subſtance, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful for Turners, in making all ſorts of little Wooden Ware; moreover, being a quick Grower, as all Aqualicks are, they are profitable enough for the Fire; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will affect the Propagation of theſe Trees, beſides the way before-mentioned, by bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Poles length-ways, (of which, I muſt confeſs, I never made Experience,) may raiſe whole Forreſts of them, by ſowing their Keys or Seeds upon any boggy Ground, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cover'd over or dreſs'd with Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>HAving already ſpoken of <hi>Coppice-Woods,</hi> as alſo of Trees, as they ſtand uſeful for Husbandry, we are now to conſider Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it extends to <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> which is juſtly eſteemed to be one of the moſt pleaſant as likewiſe the moſt Profitable Improvements which a Country Gentleman or a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman can make of his Eſtate. This I ſhall diſcourſe of under theſe Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> of Seeds, Nurſeries, Grafting, Soil, Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the ſeveral Kinds or Species of Fruit-Trees, with ſome Curſory Remarks upon Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, For Seeds, I hold Crab-Kernels to be abſolutely the beſt of any for a Seed-Plot, foraſmuch as the Crab-ſtock ſeems to have theſe Advantages above any other; for, firſt, it is more hardy againſt the Intemperance of Weather; in the next place, 'tis leſs capable of Injuries from gaulings, or bruiſes, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Cattle, for the Wounds they receive this way will ſoon heal; likewiſe 'tis leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Canker, and of longer Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than any Kernel-ſtock or Wilding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and altho' the Graſs ſhould die, the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47781:59"/>
Stock will weather it out, and after a little time be fit to be re-grafted; whereas Wildings or Stocks of the Seed of grafted Fruit, will rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſt and ſurvive ſuch Diſaſters.</p>
               <p>But the way of ordering ſuch Seeds is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of further Care, for to throw them upon the Ground, after Cyder-making Time, (as commonly Men do,) unleſs they be in a very great quantity, is very uncertain and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For beſides Poultry, Birds, Pigs, and the like, which at all times will be feeding and muſling on them, there is a far worſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and that is the Mole or Field-Mouſe, a Species of Vermine betwixt a Want and a Houſe-Mouſe. Theſe Moles or Field-Mice, I ſay, will feed upon the Kernels all the Winter-Seaſon; and I have found by Experience, that of a thouſand Kernels Hand-ſet in my Garden, and well cover'd with Earth, with the greateſt Care imaginable, they have been all ſtolen away by theſe Vermine in a Month's time, and leſs, ſo quick-ſcented and ſagacious are they, digging up the Seeds with as much neatneſs as if they had been drawn out of the Earth with a Finger. The like Damage I have found in Acorns, Filbirds, Walnuts, and the like, tho cover'd with Lime and Soot; all which have been dug-up and hoarded by theſe miſchievous Vermine in holes of Walls, and in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of hollow Trees, to ſerve them all the Winter.</p>
               <p>The beſt way then to deſtroy theſe Vermine is by good Cats, or before we ſow or ſet our
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47781:60"/>
Kernels, to wet ſome Kernels and flower them with Arſenick: For this will do their work effectually, as I have found by Experience; but there is a danger herein, leſt Dogs, Cats or Swine, or Poultrey, ſhould meet either with the Baits or the Vermine. As for thoſe ſilly Scribblers who write of Husbandry, and talk of placing Butter-Pots, or Traps Under-Ground to catch 'em in, they catch nothing but ſuch Fools as rely upon their Whimſies; for I am confident, they never made any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of this Nature, with Succeſs, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to entertain their Readers with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gimcracks. If a Garden therefore, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Seed-Plot be ſubject to theſe Vermin (as there are few but are) there is no other way but to throw many Loads of Muck or Muſt upon the Ground, and ſo ſome will be ſure to eſcape and ſprout; or elſe to keep the Muſt thinly ſpread in a dry Room till Spring, and then ſowing it on the Ground lightly, haw'd up, and powder'd over with fine black Earth through a Sieve, together with ſome ſhort Straw, or Mullock, thrown over to preſerve them from Birds, together with Thorns to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from Poultry, they will quickly ſprout out in that Seaſon, and prevent the Spoil from Mice, who likewiſe in warm Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and upon the approach of Spring, will not be ſo ſolicitous to make their Magazines. I ſay, then the Mulk, or Muſt, ought to be laid upon a dry Floor, and thinly ſpread, and oftentimes turn'd, being ſinely rubb'd and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47781:60"/>
crumbl'd; for lying in great Clods, much more in great Heaps, 'twill heat and rot the Kernels: Or if the Kernels were hand-pick'd out of the Pulſe of the Crabbs after Grinding, and preſerv'd in a Box till the beginning of Spring, it would be the ſureſt way of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho with a little more trouble. And thus having ſow'd the Kernels, and prepar'd the Ground, you will ſee them ſpringing up in a very ſhort time, in a great Plat or Foreſt, where growing for two or three Years, the next care muſt be to form a Nurſery by removing them out of the Seed-Plot.</p>
               <p>There are ſome ſort of Fruit-Trees which ſend Shoots from the Root, as Pears, Plums and Cherries; and if an old Tree be cut down at the Butt there will ſhout up a great number of young wildings, which may be removed to ſerve Occaſions, or be budded with choicer Fruits; but theſe Curioſities concern the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rather than the Orchard, which is the Subject I am now ſpeaking to.</p>
               <p>When young Quicks therefore are ready to be remov'd out of the Seed-Plot, our next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is of the Ground deſign'd for a Nurſery, which ought not to be over-rank, for 'twill be ſubject to Cowch Graſs, but being well dug and prepar'd trim your Quicks, and ſet them in Lines, each Row, as alſo cach Quick, at a Yard diſtance from each other, caſting into the Trench good fine Earth, with ſome well-rotted Horſe-Dung mixt together, and then cover them with the Mould thrown
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47781:61"/>
out of the next Trench, and ſo continue ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and trenching till you have finiſhed your Plantation; but be ſure above all to tread the Earth well down to the Roots, being firſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpread abroad by hand upon the prepar'd Mould. I allow a Yard diſtance betwixt the Stocks or Quicks that they may ſpread their Roots with more Freedom, and be dug up without danger to their Neighbours; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good Root of a Stock all depends. Some Garden-Stuff likewiſe ought to be Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the Ranks of the Quick to kill the long Couch-Graſs; as likewiſe, becauſe the frequent diggings after they have taken Root, accelerate their Growth by turning in freſh Mould to the Roots, which will preſerve them alſo from Men.</p>
               <p>After four or five Years growth in the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, you may think of removing them; but whether you ought to graft the Stocks in the Nurſery, or remove them firſt into the Ground you deſign for an Orchard, and there Graft them after three or four Years ſetting, is a Point I muſt a little enlarge upon; and ſo much the rather, becauſe my Opinion in this Particular, leads me contrary to the Practice of all the reſt of my Countrymen, who for a long time ſeem to have quitted the Old Way of grafting in Nurſeries, upon ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Reaſon doubtleſs, which yet I am to learn.</p>
               <p>'Tis the general Practice then of our Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to remove the Stocks firſt out of the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47781:61"/>
into the Field or Orchard; and there ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and huſting them up with Thorns, after three or four Years ſettlement, to graft upon them, upon pretence belike, that a Crab-ſtock will not be ſo apt to miſcarry as a grafted Tree, and that grafted Trees, after they are remov'd, will ſtand for ſome Years in a languiſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But notwithſtanding this, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for grafting in a Nurſery, are much more prevailing; for, in a Nurſery they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecur'd from the Injuries of Cattle, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Weather, being grafted low or near the Ground; but they are ſecur'd alſo from the Perchings of Crows, and ſuch like unlucky Birds, which in open Fields or Orchards will be ever and anon alighting upon the tender Cyons or Branches, and break them off, and looſen the Grafts. The pricking in of ſharp Sticks in the dawbing; as alſo the hanging of Feathers in Strings to move with the Wind, may ſcare them at firſt; but when the Cyons reach higher than the Sticks (as certainly they will do upon the firſt ſhoot) 'tis on them that theſe miſchievous Birds will be ſure to Perch, to the great dammage of the Tree: To which I may add the violence of the Winds and Weather, as alſo the danger of Cattle break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a new-planted Field or Orchard; as alſo, the danger from the Plow it ſelf, which oftentimes deſtroys our labour: I ſay, by theſe and ſuch like Accidents, which are almoſt unavoidable, all our Expectation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ten Years Care and Attendance, is ver
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47781:62"/>
much blaſted, and perhaps ruin'd. None of which Inconveniencies or Dangers can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in a Nurſery where a good Fence may be preſerv'd with little labour, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconveniencies be avoided.</p>
               <p>And as for the thriving ſtate of a Crab-ſtock above a Grafted one, 'tis a thing of little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the preſent Caſe: For our Nurſery-Stocks once grafted, and after three or four Years Growth being remov'd, are much more hardy than any Stock newly grafted in the open Field or Orchard, and are leſs ſubject to decay from the Wounds they ſhall receive from Thorns, Plows and Harrows; whereas young grafted Trees once gall'd or bruis'd, if not timely cur'd, will be in danger of the Canker, if not of dying. There is nothing more miſchievous to a new-grafted Stock than Thorns, which tho they may ſerve to keep off Cattle, wound the tender Shoots, thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the firſt Year (which indeed are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be taken care of) and by this Means the Branches become canker'd, and perhaps, after ſome little time, the Tree it ſelf does lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and die.</p>
               <p>As touching the Soil of an Orchard, a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Earth, a little inclining to Sand is the beſt, and Gravelly Ground the worſt. For the Gravel lying generally towards the Surface of the Earth, the Roots can draw no Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it, nor penetrate betwixt ſuch a compacted matter of little Stones: Tho Elms we find thrive beſt in ſuch a Soil, becauſe they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47781:62"/>
naturally ſpread their Roots wide, and upon the Surface, where they are ſure to meet with a fat Earth; the ſuperfice of the Ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever better then the Earth which lies deeper, whilſt the gravelly and impenetrable Ground which lies commonly a Foot or ſomething deeper then the Turf, forces them to ſpread their Roots in ſuch a way or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is moſt ſuitable to their Nature. Whereas on the other hand, the tender Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres or Strings of the Roots of Fruit-Trees, eſpecially of Apples, once touching the cold Gravel, there ſtop their progreſs, and for want of ſuitable Nouriſhment from below, the Tree ceaſes to grow, and in a ſhort Time after decayes.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe an unequal Surface or Countrey, which conſiſts of little Hills and Valleys, is much more proper for Fruit, then the level and open Campaigne: For in a wide and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Field, there is no ſhelter to keep off the ſcorching Blaſts, the cold Winds and Storms; whereas an Orchard which lies upon a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ground, and is environ'd with other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Bottoms lies warm and cover'd from Blaſts, and ſhaded too from the immoderate heats of the Sun, which eaſily ſcorch the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Bloſſom. Beſides; a declining Surface will not be apt to retain the Water too long upon the Ground, which will chill and ſtarve the Root in Winter, but the Water after it has refreſh'd the Earth gently ſoaks away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:47781:63"/>
I would have a Plantation to Face the Morning Sun, if poſſible: For 'tis the Early Sun which revives all Vegetables; whereas the Weſtern or Afternoon Sun is commonly hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from whence alſo proceed theſe gleams or hot Winds which are ſo fatal to Trees, when they are in the tender Bloſſom. And from theſe Blaſts it is; that not only the Bloſſom, but even the Leaves, and ſometimes the very Fruit, after it's advanc'd to ſome Perfection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſcorch'd and ſing'd, and even the Tree it ſelf many times dies, or at leaſt will not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf for Two or Three Years after. When the Bloſſoms fall off ſuddenly or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it is a certain ſign the Tree is blaſted; and the Leaves of the Bloſſoms which hang on will look Red and Burnt, which being pluckt off we ſhall find a grub at the Bottom engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the Wind, which grub kills the tender Fruit upon the Stalk: Or if the Fruit hang on for a little Time, the next Puff of Wind blows them down under the Tree, and ſuch as ſeem to eſcape will never be but little ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd ſtarv'd Apples, ſuch as we call Crickets.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Normandy</hi> 'tis true; they plant their Fruit-Trees in Walks, and in the wide and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Fields, ſo that we may ride every where through plains of Corn a Mile or Two, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way planted in Croſs-walks, and in double Ranks bordering upon the Corn on each ſide, with a fine Carpet of Graſs like an Alley of Twenty Yards breadth betwixt the Ranks, ſuch walks running many Times in a ſtraight
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47781:63"/>
Line for a Mile or more together; which is wonderful delightful. The Reaſon why they are not in ſuch danger of Blaſts as we are here in <hi>England,</hi> is from the clearneſs of the Air, the Country being generally Sandy, and the Winds more cooling as coming from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi> or the <hi>Britannick</hi> Sea which lies <hi>North</hi> of them; whereas with us, the Iſland we live in is more ſubject to inequality of Weather, and our Weſtern Winds which reign almoſt half the Year by Intervals, are always hot as coming from the main Ocean, in thoſe Parts of <hi>England</hi> I mean which are in Reputation for Cyder: For the River <hi>Severne</hi> running <hi>South-Weſt,</hi> and widening it ſelf in a very great Meaſure the nearer it draws to the Sea; the Winds come up the River as it were convey'd by a Channel, being reſtrain'd or pent betwixt the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> and <hi>Cotſwold-Hills:</hi> For which Reaſon 'tis, that <hi>Glouceſter, Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Hereford-Shires,</hi> the Three moſt celebrated Counties of <hi>England</hi> for Fruit, lye in a manner expos'd to the full ſtroak of theſe <hi>South-West</hi> Winds; which indeed are more furious and boiſterous than any other Winds with us, as (blowing from the Main Ocean) as it were by a Tunnell without any Eminence or Tract of Land to break its Violence; which being hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter likewiſe by reaſon of the Southern Coaſt from whence they come, than thoſe of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quarter, and at ſuch Time as the Air is thick and foggy (as generally it is in our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Iſlands) the heat meeting with ſuch an

impure Air, begets an Aduſt gloomy kind of Vapour like to Smoak, which the Peaſants call a Red Wind, and this is that which blaſts and deſtroys the tender Fruit and Bloſſoms.</p>
               <p>In a Plantation or Orchard likewiſe, great reguard is to be had to the diſtance of the Trees: In a large Plantation for the purpoſe, I would not have them to be ſet nearer then twenty Paces to one another, nor wider then thirty, that ſo there may be ſpace for the Trees to ſpread, and for the Corn to grow. Likewiſe I would have the Ground laid down plain, and not in Furrows or Ridges, becauſe of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Ranks ſtreight, and at an equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which thoſe who plant upon the Tops of plow'd Lands cannot do, being oblig'd to follow the turnings and windings of the Ridge. And after the Stocks are well root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as in Two or Three Years Time they will be) then plowing up the Ground for Tillage is the beſt Method imaginable to bring on an Orchard: For Trees will thrive more in Two Years on plow'd Ground than in five Years on Paſture.</p>
               <p>Moreover in planting theſe Rules are to be obſerv'd. 1ſt, To put a good quantity of old black Mould to the Root of the Stock and to work it in well with the hand betwixt the Joints and Strings of the Root, whoſe Branches muſt be cut ſlanting underneath, ſo that the Bark may cover them; otherwiſe they will rot. 2dly, The Earth muſt be trod down very cloſe: For if it lie hollow, the Root in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47781:64"/>
will be dried up, and in Winter 'twill retain Water, which, when frozen, will kill the Root. 3dly, Let all Stocks be planted lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the South-Weſt, the Winds of which Quarter are longer and more violent than any other Winds whatſoever, and will make a Stock ſet upright to grow irregular and crooked; whereas by this Method the Force of the Wind will bring what is leaning againſt it more and more towards an upright, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Tree to ſtand firm againſt the Fury of theſe Weſtern Shocks. 4thly, In ſtaking them great Care muſt be taken, that the Stakes do not gall or bruiſe the Trees: As for Briering or Thorning them, it is ſuperfluous, except in ſuch Places where Cattle go; and for ſuch Orchards they will come to little, for do what we can the Cattle will ſome time or other brouze them, and in Ground not plow'd, the Stocks will come on very poorly. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who love good Orchards, muſt keep their Ground in Tillage always, and by this means turn in freſh Mould to the Roots; ſo that here is no need of Thorns, where Cattle are not ſuppos'd to go.</p>
               <p>'Tis not good, for the firſt or ſecond Year, after a Stock is grafted, to prune off the Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for the tender Grafts not being ſtrong enough of themſelves to draw up the Sap, the Tree of neceſſity muſt wither and die. This I have found by often Experience; ſo that many times the Grafter is condemn'd, when the Fault lies in the ſuperfluous Curioſity
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47781:65"/>
of the Husbandman: But where the Cyons or Grafts are grown big enough to draw up the Sap in ſuch a Proportion as may keep the Trunk of the Stock green and flouriſhing, then off with the Suckers. Likewiſe 'tis a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way to nip the Shoots of the firſt Year; for beſides that, Crows will be apt to perch upon ſuch tender Shoots and break them, 'tis certain that ſuch high weak Shoots are very lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be ſhaken by the Wind, and in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Seaſon to be pinch'd by the Cold and Froſt, which will much endanger the Grafts, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Winds in <hi>March</hi> be any thing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; for ſuch Branches will either wither, or be canker'd, as I have obſerv'd from the cold Winds and Froſts in <hi>March</hi> 93, 94, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially 96, which was the moſt unkind Seaſon for Fruit-Trees which hath happen'd in any Age. The Midſummer-Shoot, for the ſame Reaſon, is much to be preferr'd before that of the Spring; for they come forth ſhort and buſhy, and by the next Year will be ſtrong enough to reſiſt any ordinary Shocks of Wind and Weather, and are out of all danger from the perching of Crows.</p>
               <p>Good daubing likewiſe is of great Moment to a Tree; for if the Cleft be not well ſecur'd from wet, the Tree will be in danger, ſo that as often as the Clay or Mortar is waſh'd or worn off, it ſhould be renew'd again, till the Bark covers it. Likewiſe, if a Tree be grafted with two Cyons, 'tis beſt to pare off one of them cloſe to the Head of the Stock as ſoon as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47781:65"/>
the Grafts come to any bigneſs; for they will be apt to grow one within another, and ſo be canker'd. The Reaſon therefore of putting two Grafts into the Inciſion, is for the better Security, in caſe one ſhould fail, as alſo to draw up the Sap in greater Plenty; tho' I hold it abſolutely ſafer to graft in the Nurſery with a ſingle Graft upon a young ſlender Stock, for ſuch rarely miſcarry, and the Cleft is ſoon skinn'd over; the Sap likewiſe is more eaſily drawn up, and the Branches will ſhoot far enough aſunder, without danger of twiſting one within another.</p>
               <p>The Maladies to which Fruit-Trees are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are, firſt, Moſs; and this proceeds either from Old Age, and then it is incurable, or from the bending of the Bark; the Remedy whereof is lancing, or elſe digging about the Roots in Winter: But if Moſs proceed from the Wetneſs of the Soil, I hold it likewiſe to be incurable. Scraping or burning of the Moſs with Straw, may ſerve for a time, but 'twill return again as long as the Cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. The Canker is another Diſeaſe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Trees; if it be in the Branches, I look upon it as incurable; for the canker'd Branch being cut off, the after-Shoots will likewiſe be canker'd, till you pare away all the Branches: Eſteem therefore ſuch a Tree to be fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Fire. This Diſeaſe many times proceeds from the Wounds which the tender Shoots of a new-grafted Tree receive from Thorns growing or ſtuck near about it; but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47781:66"/>
it is not ſo always, for ſome Trees will be canker'd, do we what we can. Many tell us that the Canker proceeds from the Rankneſs of the Ground, or from the Nature of the Fruit, ſo that Grafts cut from a canker'd Tree will prove canker'd likewiſe. This I cannot ſpeak to by Experience; only, that where a Canker is in the Body of a Stock (as it happens fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) by reaſon of ſome bruiſes or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the Plow, Harrows, Traces, and the like, the beſt way is with a ſharp-pointed Knife to cut round about it to the quick, and it will ſtop from going farther, and yield a new Rind or tender Bark; otherwiſe, if the Sap be ſtirring, the Bark will peel, and looſen much farther than the Bruiſe, and wither away, to the great Danger of the Stock: Therefore, after the Inciſion round about the Bruiſe, let the naked Place be cover'd with Earth and Cow-Dung mix'd and bound about with a twiſt of Hay daub'd with Cow-dung likewiſe, and after a Year or two the Breach will be cur'd, and ſometimes be intirely skinn'd over with a new Rind. I have obſerv'd the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker likewiſe to proceed from the Extremity of Weather, or bitter Winds, about the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> at ſuch time as the Trees, by the precedent Seaſon, which has been very mild, were in the faireſt way to make us hope for a Bleſſing; ſo that the Sap being then ſtirring upwards, and thus arreſted by the unuſual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of the Spring, the Trees themſelves have been much mortified, and eſpecially ſuch
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47781:66"/>
young ones as have not been grafted above three or four Years. All which I have found by woful Experience in the Year 1694, when of above a hundred young Trees grafted in my Nurſery and Orchards, I give above one half of them for irrecoverably loſt; which Damage of being Canker-eaten they receiv'd the two precedent Springs, which were the moſt rigorous for cold Winds that ever were known. We may obſerve in Trees that are canker'd in the Branch, that tho' you cut it off to the quick, there will be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Eye or Speck in the remaining Branch, like the Speck in the Corn upon the Ear, which runs deeper and deeper, till it comes to the Body, and then hold ſuch a Tree to be good for nothing but the Fire; but in caſe it has not enter'd too far, poſſibly the Tree or Stock may be ſaved, by regrafting it with a Winter Quinnin, a Bodenam-Crab, or the Apple we call a Boon-apple, as likewiſe the Golden-pippin, for theſe I obſerve never to canker: I have thus regrafted divers, but I have not yet had time to ſee the Effects, having made the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment but this Year 97. The Apple we call a Woodcock is no way apt to canker, as I have found by Experience, and for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to be highly eſteem'd, as well as for its excellent Liquor, being likewiſe a great and conſtant Bearer, and not ſubject to be blaſted. Theſe ſorts of Fruits are very apt to canker, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bromſtraw-Crab, the White, Red, and Red-ſided Muſs, the Sweet-Pipin; ſo
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47781:67"/>
that where any of theſe Trees are infected with this Diſeaſe, let them be new Grafted, if not too far gone, in which Caſe let them be dug up.</p>
               <p>The Winds in Winter are generally look'd upon to be very helpful to Trees, in order to make them fruitful by looſning the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Roots.</p>
               <p>If Trees be unthrifty, as in Orchards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plow'd it often happens, their Roots muſt be uncovered about <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> till the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſome old rotten Dung well temper'd with the Earth, and cloſe-trod down, or Aſhes mixt with Earth, and the like. Ants are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pernicious to Trees, and are deſtroy'd by digging and putting Soot to the Roots.</p>
               <p>Lime is found to be a very great Enemy to Orchards, there not being half the Fruit as formerly, ſince this way of helping Ground for Corn has been practic'd; ſo that even the Trees themſelves dwindle and decay; nay I may confidently affirm, notwithſtanding the Humour of planting in this preſent Age that there is not half the Cyder made as was about Thirty Years ago; the foreſaid liming of Land, and the many ſevere Springs we have had of late Years, being the True and Natural Cauſes of ſuch decaies.</p>
               <p>I would adviſe all Lovers of Fruit-Trees to have a little Plantation near there Houſe, and this to be cloſe ſet with Trees not above Ten Yards aſunder; ſo that in an Acre of Ground thus planted, there will grow a hundred Trees:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47781:67"/>
The Reaſon of ſuch a Plantation is this, that when the lower Plantations or Orchards are blaſted, this may ſupply that loſs: For Trees growing cloſe together are apt to ſave one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to ſhelter themſelves from the Froſt, Cold Winds, and Blaſts. Beſides, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the Dwelling-Houſe, Barns and other Out-houſes will afford Security likewiſe. 'Tis true; ſuch little Orchards cannot be plow'd where the Trees ſtand ſo Thick; in this Caſe therefore the Ground muſt be dug, which Method though it be more Expenſive will turn to the greater Advantage of the Trees, and return a plentiful Crop of Beans, or other Garden-Stuff. And upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that Trees growing in Gardens or near a Houſe in ſuch Order as I have deſcrib'd, proſper very well when others are ſmitten. 'Tis good likewiſe to have Trees growing in Hedges for the ſame Reaſon: For ſuch Hedges will ſhelter them from the Bluſtering Winds and from the nipping Froſts. And although ſuch Hedge-Rowes do not yield ſo large a Crop, and are troubleſome to be glean'd, yet 'tis good to have ſome, tho in a leſſer quantity, when the larger Plantations ſhall miſcarry.</p>
               <p>I muſt Confeſs, that Trees planted in Hedge Rows are not very proſperous, unleſs on a light Sandy a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d declining Bank, where the Water may run off quickly out of the Ditches; or rather, where there are no Ditches at all: For where there are Ditches, and on a level, the Water is apt to lye long in the Winter
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47781:68"/>
Time and ſtain the Root: For Remedy whereof ſome cut up their Hedges at the Butt, and plain the Ditches, planting a New Hedge at ſome diſtance: By this Method the Trees will recover themſelves incredibly; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the profit ariſing thereby be worth the Charge and Trouble of raiſing a New-Hedge, I leave to the good Husbandmans Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tho' I think ſuch Hedge Rowes where there are Ditches on the other ſide, which hold Water moſt the Winter, are little to be reguarded.</p>
               <p>I like alſo very well to ſuffer ſome Kernel Fruit or Wildings to grow in the Orchard, for ſuch Trees will never Canker, they reſiſt the Violence of nipping Winds, Froſts and Blaſts, ſo that we may be ſure of having a fair Account of them, which is a Thing of ſome Benefit, for though the Fruit be harſh, yet 'twill ſerve for the Ordinary Occaſions of a Family, and 'tis better to have harſh Cyder than none at all.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the ſeveral Kinds of Apple-Trees, and of Cyder.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>COme we now to conſider the ſeveral Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or Kinds of Fruit-Trees, with which a good Orchard ought to be Planted, where I ſhall firſt begin with Apples, of which the chiefeſt ſorts are theſe; the Red-ſtreak, the Sweet Pipin, the Bromſtraw-Crab, the Winter-Quinnin, the Pear-Main, the Boddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Crab, the John-Apple or Oaken-Pin, the Moile, the Wood-Cock, with the White, Red, and Red-ſided Muſs, the Bon-Apple, the Braſling.</p>
               <p>I begin with the Red-Streak, which I place in the Front, or firſt Rank, not that I do eſteem it does deſerve that Place, but out of Complaiſance with the Humours and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men. This kind of Apple thrives no where ſo well as in <hi>Hereford-Shire,</hi> where the Trees grow to a very great bigneſs; whereas in <hi>Glouceſter-Shire</hi> at the diſtance of ſome few Miles, though they thrive well at firſt, yet they never arrive to any bulk, but run out into ſmall ſlender Branches and dwindle away, the Natural Cauſe whereof I am to learn, ſince there is no viſible difference in the Soile and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47781:69"/>
manner of Ordering them; hence it is, that Men are forc'd many Times to behead ſuch Trees, and regraft them with ſome other Fruit. A knotty Nut-grain Stock is commonly the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be grafted with a Red-Streak.</p>
               <p>As for the Liquour which it yields, it is highly eſteem'd for its noble Colour, and Smell; 'tis likewiſe Fat and Oily in the Taſte, but withal very Windy, Luſcious and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and will ſooner Cloy the Stomach then any other Cyder whatſoever, leaving a wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh raw Humour upon it; ſo that with Meals 'tis no way helpful, and they who drink it, if I may judge of them by my own Palate, will find their Stomachs pall'd ſooner by it, than warm'd and enliven'd: Nevertheleſs the Price it carries makes it worthy to be eſteem'd by the Drinker, but more by the Seller; and when it's Vertues are duly examin'd, I doubt not but it will looſe Credit with both. There are two ſorts of Red-Streak, the large Red Red-Streak (as they call it) and the leſſer, which is ſtreak'd with Veins of Green and Red: The former is the fairer to the Eye, the latter is the better for Cyder. The common Price of Red-Streak Cyder is Three Pounds at the Mill, ſometimes it has doubled that Price, but of late Years it ſinks in its Credit.</p>
               <p>The next kind of Apple for Cyder is the Sweet Winter Pippin, which muſt be well hoarded, as muſt alſo the Red-Streak, before we grind it. They will not Sweat in the hoard under a Fortnight, and to grind any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47781:69"/>
Fruit ſooner, tho' the Liquor may be more in quantity, 'twill be leſs in goodneſs, and in the mellowneſs of the Taſte. This ſort of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it ſelf makes no very good Cyder, as being ill-colour'd, pale, and greeniſh, thick alſo and ſweetiſh, and with a little Age turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreggiſh or ropy. The way then is to grind with them an equal quantity of Broms-brough Crabs, after they have been well hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſweat, together.</p>
               <p>The Bromsbrough-Crab is an Apple pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to thoſe Parts of <hi>Glouceſter-ſhire,</hi> which lie betwixt the <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Wye.</hi> It is a large greeniſh Apple, hard, and ill taſted, and therefore it may be planted in the Fields ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, there being nothing in the Fruit which may invite the Eater. Likewiſe 'tis a good Bearer, but 'tis a little too apt to drop, and does not ripen all together; as it happens alſo with many other Fruits, of which I ſhall ſpeak anon. They muſt be under-ſhook therefore, and ſo be gather'd as they ripen. They are a Winter-Fruit, and of the ſame Duration with the Sweet-Pippin, and of it ſelf makes a ſtrong, rough, maſculine Cyder, of a moſt noble Amber Colour, a little inclining to Red; it is not very pleaſant, but withal very full of Spirit, and warms the Stomach, and in quality much reſembles thoſe Wines which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Aſciutto,</hi> being rough and drying, being ſuch as will keep good in the Veſſel for two Years, and in Bottles for divers. The true way then of uſing this excellent Fruit, is to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47781:70"/>
let it hoard till about the middle of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and then to grind it with the Sweet-Pipin, where the roughneſs of the one will be allay'd and qualify'd with the ſweetneſs of the other, and theſe two Fruits in conjunction make ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the beſt and richeſt Liquor our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try does afford, whether we conſider the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is equal to that of Red-ſtreak, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Goodneſs of the Liquor it ſelf; which, tho' not ſo ſweet and luſcious as Red-ſtreak, is really of a true Vinous Nature and Flavour, or of an excellent Smell, and heady, and warm upon the Stomach, in which latter Vertue or Property it far ſurpaſſes the Red-ſtreak: And when Goodfellows (as we call them) drink for Drinking's ſake, or upon a Debauch, it works it ſelf off the beſt of any Liquor. But whether this be to its Commendation, or no, I know not; yet if Men will be intemperate, the Fault is not in the Liquor but in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the former being no more blameable than a Razor, the goodneſs of whoſe Edge may be us'd by ſome not to ſhave, but to cut their own Throats. One Fault there is, to which Trees grafted with Bromsbrow are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is the Canker, which if they do eſcape, (as ſometimes they may, from ſome peculiar Goodneſs and Quality of the Ground,) I hold my Planter to have made as good a Choice of Fruit as 'tis poſſible.</p>
               <p>The Winter-Quinin, as alſo a Pearemain, make a rich, pleaſant Cyder, very hearty and mellow; and when rack'd off, and Bottled,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47781:70"/>
is very delicious and grateful. But theſe ſorts of Trees are no very great Bearers, nor do they grow to any conſiderable bulk, and therefore may be more ſerviceable at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Diſhes than in Glaſſes.</p>
               <p>The Bodnam-Crab is a little, ſmall Apple, ſomething vein'd and colour'd like a Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreak, or a Lady-Apple. It is a good Bearer, but very ſubject to drop or ripen by little and little. You muſt plant them therefore near the Houſe, in ſome incloſed Spot of Ground, which is well ſecur'd from Cattle, Pigs, and Poultry; which laſt they cannot well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from, unleſs we totally baniſh them from our Habitation, which I am confident every Gentleman, or Gentlewoman rather, who have any Eſteem for their Fruit, and a good Garden, will readily approve of; for I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them the moſt unprofitable and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Creatures that can vex a Houſe, and fit only for Farmers, and poor People, who make little difference betwixt themſelves and their Beaſts. But to return to our Bodnams, which being a Fruit which is ever dropping, may lie and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llow on the Ground; or elſe we may gather them as they fall, and put them in a heap by themſelves in the Apple-Loft; or we may under-ſhake them, as I ſpake before of Bromsbroughs. They may be ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time with other Winter-Fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> from the beginning to the middle of <hi>November.</hi> It is no very juicy Apple, but it makes amends for that in the Redneſs of it, I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47781:71"/>
holding good Bodnam Cyder among other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of the firſt Rate. This Apple has its Denomination from an Ancient Family in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordſhire,</hi> where I ſuppoſe it was firſt in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. One Prerogative this Fruit has, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not ſubject to Canker; ſo that if there be an Occaſion of regraſting a Tree over-grown with this Diſeaſe, there cannot be a better Remedy than the Bodnam.</p>
               <p>The Woodcock is a fair large Apple, and produces an excellent Cyder, comparable with the beſt. The Fruit is not unacceptable at the Table, and the Stocks grafted with this Fruit are not liable to ſo many Diſeaſes and Accidents as other Trees, and it is likewiſe a good Bearer.</p>
               <p>The John-apple, or Oaken-pin, of all Fruits is the worſt for Taſte, being moſt harſh and hard: They will hang on the Tree till <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and keep till Apples come again, and yet worth little to eat, being dry and mealy; notwithſtanding it may ſerve well enough for the Paſtry, in regard they may be had when all other Apples are gone. However, being ground in the Mill, it makes an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſort of Cyder: The Time of Grinding it, is after <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> if the Froſts be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-violent; for they hang upon the Tree the longeſt of any Fruit, and I take it for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule, that the Fruit which is longeſt a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening makes the beſt Cyder. 'Tis true, this ſort of Apple yields but little Juice, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al 'tis a very great Bearer, and conſtant, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47781:71"/>
fears neither Thief nor Weather: For which Reaſon it ought to have a Place allow'd it in a Gentleman's Orchard, even amongſt his choiceſt Fruits, how little ſoever this kind of Apple is valued by the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>The Apple call'd a Bon-apple is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, and yet I eſteem it, when I conſider all its Properties, to be abſolutely the beſt and moſt profitable of any that grows: For, firſt, 'tis a conſtant and fruitful Bearer, the Apple large and firm, like a Sweet Pipin, but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a longer ſhape; ſecondly, 'tis never ſubject to the Canker, nor to be blaſted, and the Fruit as well taſted and laſting as the Pipin, and fairer to the Eye. In the laſt place, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords an excellent Cyder, hearty, mellow, and laſting as any. They ſeldom or never ſail of Bearing, and therefore they ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before all others, as they will be, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by all who ſhall have Experience of them.</p>
               <p>The Bradling is another ſort of Apple, near of kin to the Bon-apple, for its Hardineſs, and its Reſiſtance of the Canker, that Fatal Malady to which almoſt all other Trees are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious The Cyder which this Apple yields is likewiſe good and hearty.</p>
               <p>The Moyle is a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rt of Summer-Fruit; they are rais'd of Suckers, or little Setlings, like Codlings; it makes an incomparable pleaſant Liquor, but a little weakiſh, and fit only to be drunk by Ladies in the Summer, and will not keep ſo long as the more maſculine Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47781:72"/>
to which it bears the ſame Reſemblance as the <hi>Verdea</hi> does to the ſtronger Wines of <hi>Florence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſpoken of Winter-Cyder-Fruits, we come in the next place to diſcourſe of ſuch as we call Summer-Fruits, amongſt which there are ſeveral ſorts of Muſs, which deſerve to be taken notice of; as, firſt, the White Muſs or Summer-apple, commonly ſo call'd, it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to eat, and has a grateful Tartneſs with it; it is alſo a great Bearer, and a quick Grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and makes an early Cyder pert and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and fit for the Table. 'Twill hardly keep pleaſant a Year about, and is very good for the common Occaſions of a Family. The Red Muſs is a pleaſant, fair Apple to the Eye, and is fit likewiſe for the Table, and makes a ſort of Cyder much the ſame for Strength and Taſte with the White or Summer-apple. The great Objection againſt this Fruit, is, that it drops very much, and is ſubject to be very Worm eaten, which will be apt to make the Cyder bitteriſh.</p>
               <p>The Red-ſided Muſs is an Apple likewiſe of the ſame bigneſs with the two former, and has a Tincture of Red upon one ſide. It is longer a ripening than the two former kinds, and will require to be well hoarded, ſo that this Species of Fruit may be reckon'd for ſuch as is betwixt a Summer and a Winter-Apple. The Cyder it makes is much more maſculine than that of the White and Red Muſs, and comes neareſt to the Bromsbrow for ſtrength. It has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47781:72"/>
a deeper Colour than either of the other, and being rack'd off, and bottled, it may ſerve well at the Treat, and is very good in Winter, and the older 'tis, the better is its Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, which the fair Sex amongſt us would be glad to find in themſelves.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe an Apple call'd the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Muſs, which hangs as long on the Tree as Pippins, Brombrows, or any other hoarding Fruit. It makes likewiſe good hearty Cyder, and it is good to have Variety.</p>
               <p>As for Hemmings, Tankard-apples, Lady-apples, and the like, they ſerve alſo for the ſame Variety, and tho' their Liquor be not in any great Reputation, yet their Fruitfulneſs makes amends: For I look upon the Lady-apple, which in Colour moſt reſembles a Red-ſtreak, to be the greateſt Bearer that is, tho' indeed it makes the thinneſt Cyder: However ſuch Liquors ſerve very well the Occaſions of a Family when the other Fruits are a ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>It would be a Curioſity worthy of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Trial, to ſow Kernels of all ſorts of Fruits whatſoever, whether of Apples or Pears, not promiſcuouſly, but every kind by its ſelf, and obſerve what ſort of Fruit every ſort of Kernels would produce: By this means, doubtleſs, many new and curious ſorts might, with great Delight and Profit, be propagated, and the Experiment might be enlarg'd farther by grafting one Wilding upon another, by which Mixture more new Species would ſtill
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47781:73"/>
appear. The Red-ſtreak, call'd likewiſe the Scadamore-Crab, the Bromsbrow-Crab, and the Bodnam-Crabs, were all of them, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, at firſt but Wildings or Kernel-Fruit, improv'd after by grafting; which three ſorts of Crabs make really the richeſt Cyder that can be found amongſt us, and of the nobleſt Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
               <p>I would moreover adviſe every Gentleman who has a Love for Cyder, to ſtore his Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with all ſorts of Fruits, and planted in all ſorts of Grounds, and all ſorts of Ways, <hi>viz.</hi> in Open Fields or Orchards, in Hedge Rows, and near his Houſes: Some Fruits like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bloſſoming at one time, and ſome at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 'tis very likely whilſt ſome Trees miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry and receive Damage by the Winds and Froſts, others which are not yet in Bloſſom, or which have bloſſom'd ſome time ago, or which are under ſome ſort of Covert or Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may eſcape from Danger.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enter into a Diſcourſe upon the Art of making Cyder: 'Tis the duly Practiſe of every Family. Some Things however there are which ought daily to be look'd to by ſuch who hope to be Maſters of good Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; of which the firſt is the hoarding of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and here I hold it much better to lay them in a Chamber on heaps, than to leave them ſweating in Gardens or on Graſs-plots; for lyi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ks in the Sweating is imbib'd therein; which cannot but much impoveriſh and flatten the Liquor: All which Miſchiefs are avoided when Apples are hoarded within Doors and on a Chamber-Floor. Beſides, Fruit ripens ſooner within than without Doors, becauſe in the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing or ſerment, the Spirits are neither imbib'd by the Spongy Earth, nor ſo apt to fly away in the Open Air, which muſt needs help forward the Digeſtion by mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the Apples, the Heat being leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to waſt and Diſſipation.</p>
               <p>Another thing to which we ought to have regard, is the drawing-off or racking of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Lees, after it has done working, and is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cking ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the Cyder much, and contributes to its Vegeteneſs and Conſervation; for by lying long upon the Grounds or Lees, it attracts an Acidity, which in a ſhort time will make it eager and fretting. The true Seaſon of rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Summer-Cyders, that is, ſuch as are made of Apples early ripe, is about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> when it has been a little clarified by the Froſts. But for ſtronger Cyders, which carry a great Body, or Spirit rather, and come from the Mill as thick and ſweet as Honey, they are not to be touch'd till the Winter be paſs'd, and then, if not pretty clear, they muſt be rack'd a ſecond or perhaps a third time; ſo that I have had Pippin and Bromsbrow Cyder, which has not been fine or fit for botling under a Twelve-month,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47781:74"/>
the Fruit being extraordinary ripe and well hoarded when 'twas made. But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Seaſon for botling of Cyder is about two Months after the Racking, which falls out about <hi>May;</hi> for then the Cyder nits or frisks in the Veſſel, which is the critical Seaſon of botling, and if it be not taken then, all the botling in the World will not make it brisk and lively: Tho' ſtill I ſay, that the thicker the Cyder when it comes from the Preſs, the more Rackings it muſt undergoe till it becomes fine, ſparkling, and without Dreggs.</p>
               <p>They who have a Curioſity for Cyder, muſt have regard likewiſe to many other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; as firſt for the Mill; that of Stone is found by experience, to be much better than the Steel-Engine, ſo much talkt of alate, which is ever and anon apt to be out of Order, ſo that many have quitted the uſe of them, returning to their Stone Mills again. Next, for preſſing of Cyder, there are ſeveral ways of doing it: The way of preſſing by one Screw is better than by two. The Muſs, or broken Pulp, being thrown into Cribbs, Boxes, Knewcloaths, Baskets, or wrapt up in Twiſts of clean Rye Straw, in which particulars, every man may follow his own Experience and Fancy. I ſhall not trouble my Reader about Ordering the Veſſels, this being part of the Concerns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the good Houſewiſe; and yet if there be any fault in this particular, (as many times there is) the Liquor, and perhaps the Veſſel, is irrecoverably loſt. The beſt way
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47781:74"/>
then as ſoon as the Liquor is drawn of, is to ſtop up the Veſſel cloſe, and never to turn out the Lees or Sedement till it comes to be us'd again: For in caſe any Air or Moiſture get into it, 'twill ſoon poyſon and corrupt the Grounds, which will give ſuch a naſty, oily Smell to the Veſſel, as can rarely be got out by burning, or any Method whatſoever. Some indeed there are, which after the Cyder is drawn of, waſh the Veſſel very well with cold Water, and when it is clean from all its Lees, they dry it well in the Sun or Wind, and ſo let it ſtand till they have occaſion again to uſe it. This way of waſhing with cold Water is eſteemed much better than with ſcalding Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe the hot Water is more apt to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the Wood, by which means the ſmell of the Cyder is ſoak'd out of the Pores of the Veſſel, which are fill'd with a wateriſh Vapour, which when cold will be apt to make the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel mouldy; whereas cold water waſhing off on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſlimy filth which ſticks to the ſides, leaves the Wood of the Veſſel well ſeaſoned with a ſtrong ſmell of the good Liquor, which will very much help the Cyder which hereafter ſhall be put into it. Some regard likewiſe muſt be had to the Bottles, that they be very clean waſh'd and dry'd, otherwiſe after ſome little time, there will be a kind of Cream upon the Neck of the Cyder, which will very much deprave it, and fill it full of Dreggs, and make it diſtaſtful. The newer the Cyder is the more ſpace muſt be left betwixt the Cork and the Liquor in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47781:75"/>
the Bottle: For upon Change of Weather, it will be apt to work, and being windy, if too cloſe fill'd 'twill endanger the breaking of the Bottle. Likewiſe, ſuch Corks ought to be well ty'd down, for they will riſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> draw with the windineſs of the Cyder, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fly out in the Air. Cyder therefore ought to be old, and well digeſted of its windy Quality, before ever it be bottled, and yet if kept too long, or prickt, 'twill never recover it ſelf, and after ſome time, it ſhall gather a flying Lee or Dreg, which is a certain ſign 'tis loſt. I ſhall not ſpeak of the artificial Helps of Cyder, eſteeming the Liquor which ſtands in need of them, to be worth very little, and yet ſo it is, that many of our Cyder-Merchants make their greateſt Profit by theſe Adulterating, and artificial Practices. By theſe Marks 'tis eaſie to know adulterated Cyder: It frisks a little at firſt, but then it flattens preſently, and taſtes a little deadiſh and ſweet; 'tis likewiſe thick and muddy, and raw upon the Stomach, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has ſtood a little in the Glaſs, 'tis utterly inſipid: Whereas that which is true and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, retaines it's ſparkling Quality for a long Time, and through the whole Body of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; it is as clear as <hi>Amber,</hi> warms the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and invites the Drinker to a further Tryal; it is clear to the laſt Drop, and has an excellent Perfume or Smell, and with its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or Vapours it very much refreſhes the Brain by Reaſon of its Native fragancy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of Perry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is another ſort of Liquor made of Pears, called by the <hi>French Poiree,</hi> and by us <hi>Perry:</hi> This ſort of Cyder was in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reputation in former Ages then Apple-Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and tho for many Years paſt, it gave place to it, being in a manner ſupplanted by it, yet now again it begins to recover it's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Credit and Eſteem; not only becauſe it begins to be ſcarce and rare, there being no new Plantations of Pears, whilſt the old Trees daily fall into decay; but it is in vogue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for the Nature of the Liquor, which is found to have a ſtrong Spirit in it, for which Reaſon it hath been much bought up of late by our Diſtillers, who extract a ſort of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy out of this Liquor, as they do likewiſe from Apple-Cyder.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon why it loſt its Credit formerly was; 1ſt. Becauſe it was not laſting, for in the hot Weather 'twas apt to be ropy and dreggiſh. 2dly, 'Twas more windy than the Juice of Apples, and thought unfit for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to Drink, as being apt to engender the Stone: And Laſtly, If drunk new 'tis look'd upon to be very unwholeſome, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47781:76"/>
very Cold and Laxative. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, Perry is found to be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Husbandman, and to have ſome Advantages above Apple-Cyder, and that in theſe Reſpects; for, 1ſt, Pears when grafted come on faſter, and are not ſo apt to miſcarry as Apple-Trees, the Grafts ſeldom die, much leſs the Stock. 2dly, They laſt much longer than Apple-Trees, and grow to a far greater Bulk of Timber. 3dly, They will grow and thrive beſt in a cold watry or clay Soil, where Apple-Trees will not live. 4thly, They are not ſo apt to be blaſted as Apples, nor ſubject to Cankers; and when Old, the Timber of them if cut in ſeaſon is very uſeful and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful for Drawers, Tables, Cabinets, and ſuch like Curioſities. Pears likewiſe are conſtant and great Bearers, and yield a moſt plentiful Juice, and being mix'd and ground with Crabs, will afford a very wholeſome and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable Liquor and laſting enough; which tho it be rough and harſh agrees well with labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Men, and gets them a good Stomack and will not waſh thorough them ſo ſoon as Mault-Drink. Upon which Conſiderations, I hold Pear-Trees to be the moſt profitable Fruit for a Farmers Uſe: For where they grow they rarely be at charge for other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and where Men live Temperate, by the means of this ſort of Drink they are very healthy, and arrive to a great Age, as appears evidently by the Inhabitants of ſome parts of <hi>Worceſter-Shire,</hi> where Perry ſtill continues in great Plenty and Eſteem.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:47781:76"/>
The beſt ſort of Pears for Perry, are the Squaſh-Pears; they are very fair and large, and yield a moſt plentiful Juice, very delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hearty, and will keep the longeſt of any Liquor made of Pears: It is a good Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Horſe-Pear likewiſe is a good Fruit for Liquor, but not ſo much in Credit as the Squaſh-Pear. There are two ſorts of them, the Red and the White. Perry-Pears have this Advantage, that tho' they drop and lie under the Trees, they are not in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devour'd by Swine, being of a very rough and harſh Taſte, much leſs are they in danger of being ſtolen by Boys and other pilfering People, whilſt they hang upon the Trees. Summer-Pears, ſuch as Gernets, Orange-Pears, Windſor-Pears, and the like, being ground with ſome old Cyder, and a little Vinegar, and the like, will afford a very pleaſant, pert Liquor, to be ſpent early, as in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> before other can be had.</p>
               <p>Now, although Fruit-Trees be one of the greateſt Bleſſings we can receive from the Earth, next to Bread, for I eſteem a good Plantation to be as profitable as a Vineyard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, nay more profitable, as being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd with little or no Labour: Nevertheleſs, it hath been obſerv'd, that in ſuch Places as moſt abound with Fruit, the Owners of ſuch Plantations are not always the moſt thriving Men; for ſo it is, that Cyder being ſold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times at a low Rate, Men chooſe rather to turn what is ſuperfluous into their own fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47781:77"/>
Veſſels, than play the Merchants with a Drugg of ſo ſmall Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t. This Cuſtom of Bibbing, or drinking waſtfully, (which in the Country is call'd good Neighbourhood, and keeping a Good Houſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>At preſent there is, or at leaſt of late there has been, an Excellent Project a foot, which, doubtleſs, will much increaſe the Planting of Fruit, and make very conſiderably for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Undertakers; I mean the new Invention of drawing-off the Spirits of Cyder by diſtilling. This kind of Brandy (tho' of a weaker nature) is very uſeful to the Nation, when we cannot be ſupplied from Abroad, and is very Profitable to the Husbandman, he being certain to convert what is ſuperfluous, and would otherwiſe be ſpent waſtfully, into good Money. So that the Project is equally Beneficial to the Nation, (eſpecially in Time of War,) as alſo to ſuch Perſons as have any Cyder to ſpare; and will prevent likewiſe that Intemperance, or unneceſſary and ſottiſh Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to which Goodfellows otherwiſe are too apt to addict themſelves, upon Pretence that they may conſume the Manufacture. Nor ought we to be mov'd at the Complaints and Murmurings of the Rabble or poorer ſort, who by this means are forc'd many times to buy their Drink, which at other times they would have as plenty as Ditch-water, ſince
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47781:77"/>
'tis found, by certain Experience, that where there is moſt Plenty there is moſt Beggery; Men ever refuſing to take Pains, or at leaſt they will be moſt exacting and high in their Wages, where they may have their Proviſions for nothing, or at any inconſiderable rate: So that we may eaſily obſerve, that in ſuch Parts of this Kingdom as are not ſo plentiful, and do not ſo much abound with this Liquor, we ſhall meet with feweſt Beggars and feweſt Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, which, without Offence, we may juſtly look upon to be Peſt-houſes of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not for the Relief they yield to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeas'd, but for the Poiſon and Infection which they diffuſe. But more of this preſently.</p>
               <p>And thus have I made ſome Curſory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon this Branch of Husbandry which concerns the Planting of Fruit-Trees, or the Orchard, glancing only upon that part of which concerns Husbandry or the Farm: As for the other Branch of it which concerns the Garden, or rather the Diſh, I mean ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fruits as ſerve for the <hi>Deſert,</hi> they lie out of my Road. Nor were I ever ſo much mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcourſe upon this Subject, nor am I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſay any thing to purpoſe; all that can be ſaid or wiſh'd for in this nature, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready copiouſly, and moſt ingeniouſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to us by the Excellent Pens of ſome <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentlemen, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Evelyn,</hi> who <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> has written moſt amply hereupon, and <hi>Sir William Temple,</hi> who by the Taſte he has

               <p>To conclude this Subject: Since the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Earth, and the Labour of the poor Countryman is the very Baſis of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and that Magazine to which thoſe who are over us have recourſe in time of Exigence, as we experiment ſufficiently in theſe our Days of Taxations; there are other things in the next place which ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd and diſcours'd upon, as being ſuch with which the Countryman is moſt nearly concern'd, and to which if due Regard be not had, all the Affairs of the Country, or of Husbandry, and even of the whole Kingdom, will be found quickly at a Stand, or rather in a declining State, and they are theſe Four: 1ſt. Publick Inns and Ale-houſes; 2dly, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Labourers; 3dly, The Poor; and laſtly, Officers or Country Magiſtrates.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of Inns and Ale-houſes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall begin with Inns and Ale-houſes: Theſe, at firſt, were allow'd for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Travellers, for the Accommodation of ſuch as reſort to Markets, and for the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of Country-People meeting with one another, to diſcourſe of their Private Bargains and Buſineſs. But however 'twas in Days of Yore, certain 'tis at preſent that there are few of theſe Houſes, eſpecially the leſſer Tipling-Houſes, which anſwer theſe Ends; and rarely ſhall we meet with any which is not proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rather to Drunkenneſs and Debauchery: For to ſuch Places as theſe it is, that the lewd and improvident Labourer frequently reſorts, upon Pretence of comforting his weary Body with a Cup of good Liquor, there ſpending the Profits of a Week's Labour with a naſty Quean, whilſt his Wife and Children are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to periſh with Famine. To prevent which Calamity, they betake themſelves to begging and ſtealing, and at length (eſpecially in their declining Days) they fall an Eſcheat to the Pariſh, or perhaps to the Gallows; having ſpent waſtfully in ſuch wicked Places what
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47781:79"/>
ſhould have maintain'd them in Old Age, and in the Time of Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>To ſuch Places as theſe it is to which the ſturdy, wandring Vagabonds, and pilfering Merchants, of both Sexes, reſort, uttering their ſtol'n Wares, and diſcovering the State and Circumſtances of Houſes they begg'd at, for the farther Inſtruction of Highwaymen and Brurglayers. In theſe Places 'tis where the innocent Traveller is betray'd by the wicked Intimations of Hoſts and Servants, eſpecially in lone-Inns upon the Road, and by ſuch means falls a Prey to Robbers who have their greateſt Shelter and Security in ſuch Country Inns: And therefore it highly concerns the Magiſtrates or Juſtices of a County, to have a watchful Eye over all ſuch Places, and rarely to Licenſe any Inn or Ale-houſe, but in or near a Market-Town or Village, where the Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of Inhabitants may give Security to Travellers, beyond the Bond and Faith of a perfidious Hoſt, or their mercenary Sureties.</p>
               <p>Farther yet: 'Tis in theſe ſweet Places of Refreſhment and Good-fellowſhip, where young Men of Fortune ſometimes, and Men of Years likewiſe, and under a declining State, ſweetly ſolace themſelves together till they are profoundly drunk; and whilſt the Reckoning multiplies, like the Lights in the Drunkards Eyes, the officious Attendants watch their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes for plundering of Pockets: But if the Gentleman hath no ready Caſh, but might be drunk upon Tick, he ſhall not want for burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47781:79"/>
Account when he comes to even his Scores; and then there muſt be a Hair of the Tails, which will at length be ſtrong enough to draw on the Dog, and make him faſten again. And thus it fares with Sots, till by neglecting their Buſineſs, and waſting their Eſtates, they fall under the Snares of a griping Mortgage: And we may obſerve, in many of theſe Places, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the more celebrated Tipling-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that as there are a ſort of ſly Knaves ready to make a Prey of Good-natur'd Culleys, ſo there is likewiſe ſome one or more little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of the Law, who, as Retainers to the Houſe, are always at hand to hamper any Gentleman in a Statutable Inſtrument as ſoon as he ſhall fall within the Nooſe of a Drunken Wager or Bargain.</p>
               <p>In theſe Places 'tis where a Congreſs of Sots, or (in the ſofter Phraſe) of Good-fellows, being drain'd together, that ſuch Perſons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little Buſineſs of their own to ſpend their Time on, fall to debating the Concerns of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo that many times a heavy Doom is paſs'd upon the Lives and Actions of honeſt Men at the dreadful Bar of an All-definitive Ale-houſe, whilſt mine Hoſt or Hoſteſs holds (if not the Balance, at leaſt the) Meaſure of Juſtice, I mean the Glaſs, which beſure ſhall never be wanting in its due Place and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in a plenary Diſtribution: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have canvas'd the Matter a little, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terluding the Farce with many impertinent and obſcene Healths, they very lovingly fall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47781:80"/>
together by the Ears, tho' more there are who fall together to the Ground by the more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blows of the All-knock-down Ale: Here it is where all Reſpect and Friendſhip is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the Teſt of a never-failing Bottle; and as for thoſe who have not the Honour to be remembred in theſe Offerings, they muſt for ever lie in Silence, as a Company of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and irreputable Reprobates.</p>
               <p>Farther: In theſe Places 'tis where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans, or (as I may ſay) the States-Provincial of a County, are held with great Solemnity. In theſe petty Conventions 'tis where all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, relating to their Office, are with great Judgment and Silence agitated and determin'd amidſt the ſmoaking of Pipes, the cluttering of Pots, and all the noiſe and ordure of a narrow Room infeſted with Drinking and a Throng; and well it is, before the Aſſembly be broken up, if ſome one or other of them do not become a Subject of Humane Frailty, even then whilſt he is upon his Duty of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſuch Diſorders. 'Twould be much more ſuitable to the Gravity of a Court of Juſtice, were it kept in ſome Town-Houſe or Market-Houſe, ſince few Market-Towns are unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſuch Publick Rooms. It would add much to the Grace of the Buſineſs, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhould ſit aloft, and conſpicuous upon the Bench (as it's becoming in a Place of Judicature,) and not be oblig'd (as may be ſeen ſometimes) to hold a Glaſs in one hand, whilſt he ſigns a Warrant with the other; tho'
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47781:80"/>
much more Eminent was he, who to ſhew the ſtedineſs of his Hand, writ and ſign'd a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant upon the heaving Belly of a boggy Hoſteſs.</p>
               <p>In fine: In theſe Places 'tis where Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are held frequently about Matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Publick, as the Elections of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives to ſit in Parliament, and the like. Here it is, that Affairs of this Nature are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and concerted; here the Reſpective Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties rendezvous and ſtrengthen their Intereſt by profuſe Entertainments, and Extravagance of Drinking; ſo that 'tis not Merit, but Ale frequently which recommends the Perſon: That Ale, I ſay, which at other Times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives Men of their Speech, here makes Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where 'tis not the emptieſt but the fulleſt Veſſels which make the greateſt ſound; and altho' Money be the chiefeſt Inſtrument in the Matter, yet are they not always the richeſt Men who ſucceed herein; inſomuch that it happens ſometimes, that a Gentleman, to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from a Proceſs, or in hopes to better his Condition, <hi>per Vias &amp; Modos,</hi> does, in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be Burgheſs of a little Burrough, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend more than all the Elections are worth, and is ruin'd, poſſibly, by it, ſeeking after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to be ſhelter'd from Arreſts, under the Shadow of being a Retainer to ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament, having f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il'd in his Grand Deſign of being one himſelf.</p>
               <p>Nor are there wanting Examples of ſuch too, who, tho' they do ſucceed, are ſo For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-ſhaken
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47781:81"/>
by the vaſt Expence they were at to procure it, that they might be rather look'd upon as coming into that Place for Sanctuary, than into a Senate-Houſe, there fencing againſt the Laws and the Proceedings of Juſtice, for Payment of their Debts, whilſt they pretend to be Patrons of the Laws, and to preſcribe Juſtice to others. The many Exorbitances and Scandals then attending ſome Elections, can proceed from no other Source but the great Liberty of a ſort of indigent, ignorant, and mercenary Wretches, to give their Voices; ſo that let a Man but cram their Mouths with three or four popular Words, as <hi>Liberty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, Popery,</hi> &amp;c. and their Bellies with Beef and Ale, theſe yelping Hell-hounds ſhall yawn and bawl, from the New to the Full of the Moon, and damn themſelves into the Bargain; many times ſwearing themſelves to be Free-holders, when they are meer Cottagers, and receive Alms from the Pariſh; ſo that this ſort of Men, how light and empty ſoever they are of themſelves, are weighty enough many times to turn the Scale of an Election. No Wonder then if Parliamentary Proceedings have not been attended with ſuch frequent Bleſſings as might reaſonably have been hop'd for, when ſuch unqualified Creatures, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by ſuch Artifices of Debauchery, have ſo great a Stroke in deſigning many times the Perſons to ſit in ſuch Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>To remedy which Diſorders, there cannot be a better Expedient than for the Parliament
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47781:81"/>
it ſelf to reform it ſelf, and particularly by depriving ſuch lewd Miſcreants of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Liberty, in giving their Voices; reducing the Forty Shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> to the true Standard and Value it was at when ſuch Qualifications were admitted of, Forty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings then being as much as Forty Pounds now adays; it being ever held the beſt way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret a Law, not by the Letter, but by the Reaſon and Intention of the Legiſlatour: For it cannot be imagin'd that a poor Fellow, of Forty or Fifty Shillings Income, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, who muſt be ſuppos'd to make up his Livelihood by Labour and Drudgery, ſhould have any mighty Underſtanding of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of King and Country, or be above the Snares of Corruption, which ſeizes eaſily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ignorant and Indigent.</p>
               <p>Were the Rabble then of ſuch beggarly Mercenaries repreſs'd, the Elected Perſons themſelves would receive great Benefit in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exempted from ſuch unſupportable Charge as uſually accompanies a popular Election; the Country likewiſe electing, would not be forc'd to neglect their Domeſtick Buſineſs, by a long Attendance: For Mens Qualifications would be better weigh'd and examin'd, and the Elections themſelves being without ſo much Noiſe and Tumult, without Delay, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo many daring Perjuries, Debaucheries and Scandals, we might have all the Reaſon in the World to hope for a Bleſſing upon ſuch National Aſſemblies; for from a free and legal
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47781:82"/>
Parliament orderly and ſoberly Elected of ſuch Perſons as are in Credit, for Prudence, Temperance, Courage and Juſtice, and with all Men of Eſtates, Honour and Integrity, we might expect ſuch mature and ſteady Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as would be the greateſt Repoſe and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo much frequented, or rather cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, as are many of the Inferiour Inns and Ale-Houſes, there are few who betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to this ſcandalous Courſe of Life, but ſuch as are Bankrupts, or of little Fame and Honeſty. The Laws of our Kingdom 'tis true, have made very good Proviſions againſt the Abuſes and Diſorders of ſuch Places; but when they who are entruſted with the Execution of them ſhall be remiſs and partial, we ſhall ſtand in need I fear of a further Execution.</p>
               <p>The ſuperfluous number of ſuch petty Inns and Ale-Houſes ſeems to proceed from theſe two Cauſes; The firſt is from the application which is made frequently on the behalf of ſome broken, half-ſtarv'd Merchant, or idle Fellow, who rather than beg, or ſteal and be hang'd, or at the beſt become chargeable to the Pariſh, hopes to get a Subſiſtence by the little Cheatings and degenerate Shifts of Ale-ſelling. The other Courſe is much of the ſame Figure, it being commonly no other than the ſordid Intereſt of ſome mean-ſpirited, Juſtices, who to maintain a ſuperfluous or indigent member of his Family, or Acquaintance, is tempted eaſily to licence Alehouſes for the ſake of Fees,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47781:82"/>
and he himſelf perhaps, forc'd to patch up his Broken-Fortunes by humbly making of Mault, which will certainly be vended in ſuch little retaling Houſes, and at ſuch Rates belike, as his Worſhip ſhall be pleaſed to truſt it at; and then, to give Reputation to the Houſe, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Ale, the good Gentleman muſt wink at Faults, and go himſelf now and then in Perſon, and bruſh it away briskly with half a Dozen good Fellows of the Neighbourhood; where to countenance this high Calling, they ſhall talk pleaſantly, as, how that the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Manufacture is for the advantage of His Majeſties Revenues; for the Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Money, and for quickening the Market, and ſuch like merry Non-ſenſe; at which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a ſly Exciſe-Man ſitting by ſhall wink a Nod, and by putting in a word or two, help forwards with the Argument: And thus they paſs away the time Jollily, licking the Froth of a rank, overgrown, and fulſome Hoſteſs, till his Worſhip is Magiſtratically Drunk, which cannot but afford great Joy and Triumph to the valiant Conqueror, as well as matter of Pity and Deriſion to the ſober Spectator.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations or Inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rather 'tis, that the number of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tippling-Houſes is conniv'd at. But I would gladly know of ſuch wet Politicians, when the Chimney-Tax was on foot, if any one of them would have ſuffer'd himſelf to be gull'd, and have built more Chimneys than would have ſerv'd his Occaſions, for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47781:83"/>
or royal End rather of increaſing His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Revenues? Nay rather, Would not every prudent Man have retrench'd his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous number of Chimneys, that he might have had ſomething elſe to have kept him warm, beſides his ſmoaky Tunnels, and much more ſmoaky Imaginations of fantaſtick Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance? Much greater Madneſs would it have been then to have built more Ale-houſes, only to increaſe ſuch Duties; and yet ſuch Sots are eaſily Piped on to deſtroy their Eſtates, and the beſt Houſes they have, I mean their Bodies, to advance the Cuſtom of ſo rich a Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. His Majeſty doubtleſs, muſt needs have a great Obligation to ſuch Loyal Sots, when to ſpeak ſeriouſly, in a Caſe ſo empty and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the Intereſt of a King or Kingdom does not conſiſt in a large Exchequer, but in the Good Management of the Publick Money, and in the Wealth, Induſtry and Affections of his Subjects, ſuch as are able and willing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Neceſſities of a Government, which can never certainly be found in thoſe who are abandon'd to an idle and ſottiſh Life. And as for thoſe who plead the advantages which ſome men may make by buying the Eſtates of waſtful Spendthrifts, they do but in other Terms tell us, that 'tis expedient for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that ſome ſhould be train'd up to be Fools, that there may be a way for Knaves to make their Fortunes; and we may as well ſay; that 'twould be good Policy to Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Encourage Knaves too, that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47781:83"/>
might have Buſineſs to be employ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and to get Money.</p>
               <p>Forreigners doubtleſs, thoſe I mean, of ſuch Countries to which our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort upon the ſcore of Breeding and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they ſee how much theſe Kinds of Houſes are by all ſorts of People celebrated and frequented, and how our Gentlemen uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at their familiar Rencounters, entertain one another with an Heroick Narrative of what hapned at ſuch or ſuch a drunken Engagement, as Men would do were they to report the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Events of ſome deſperate and bloody Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle relating with all the Punctualities of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, how many withdrew; who they were who bravely ſtood to it, and who fell fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the fight and Combat; I ſay, when Gentlemen of other Nations ſhall hear a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Relation of ſuch Generous and Martial Deeds, they cannot but ſmile, and entertain an odd Opinion and Contempt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Morals. Cabanels or Taverns being eſteem'd in other Countries, as places of Infamy fit only for Porters and ſuch trivial Chapmen, but never as ſuitable and fit Houſes for Civil Gentlemen to Rendevouz in. And indeed, if there be any Cauſe aſſignable, why the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Martial Genius of our Nation is ſo degenerated from what it was in former Ages, it can be no other then that againſt which I am now declaring. We cannot boaſt of any great Generals, at leaſt they have not the Honour to be employed as ſuch: And, for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47781:84"/>
Soldiers, tho they be naturally ſtrong and ſurly, yet are they not the beſt for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it being impoſſible for Men who are in a manner habituated to Intemperance and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of Life, to be ever able to endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Thirſt and Hunger, Heat and Cold, and to be ſubject to Diſcipline and Command, and yet in theſe Two Points, <hi>viz.</hi> Sufferance and Obedience it is, that the Perfection of a good common Soldier does conſiſt. And as for our Courage, ſo much as we boaſt our own Valour, and decry our Enemies over a Glaſs of Wine or a Pot of Ale, 'tis not ſo when we come to Action: Our Wild-Fire or ſputtring Crack being quickly ſpent with little Execution, and our Men waſh away upon the Fatigues and hardſhips of a Campaigne.</p>
               <p>From the ſame Cauſe likewiſe 'tis; that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Valour is ſo much debas'd from what it was heretofore. Their Prophet or Lawgiver <hi>Mahomet</hi> amongſt other Politick Inſtitutions, utterly forbad his Followers the uſe of Wine; which Command of his they rigorouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for divers Ages, during which Time they were very proſperous and ſucceſsful to a Prodigy. But falling from their Primitive Diſcipline, and ſuffering themſelves to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Examples of their Neighbours, as to this Point of Abſtinence, they at this Day do like the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that live amongſt them, drinking in Private to the heighth of a Debauch: By which means their Spirits being often troubled and enrag'd, they become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47781:84"/>
of Diſcipline and Fatigue, and their Strength of Body and Health being likewiſe waſted, they ſoon abandon the hardſhips of War; and this I take to be one of the greateſt Reaſons, why they have been ſo unſucceſsful in this latter Age.</p>
               <p>And really, if we look further backward upon former Ages, we ſhall find that none of the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Hero's or Generals, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>M. Antonius,</hi> were ſtigmatiz'd with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance in Drinking, and with Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And amongſt our later Worthies or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, I cannot readily call to mind any one of theſe Sons of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who were any way eminent for Conduct; but that the braveſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, ſuch as the Duke of <hi>Alva, Alexander, Farneſs,</hi> Count <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lly,</hi> with others were very remarkable for Abſtinence and Severity of Diſcipline. The Office indeed of a great Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is a Thing of Vigilance; like a Lyon he muſt be moſt watchful when he ſeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; he muſt wait upon every Critical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, and be perpetually upon his Guard. The ſeaſons of Reſt to others, and the ſilence of the Night are fitteſt for Deliberation, and for Execution many Times: He muſt conceal his Thoughts by a ſtudied reſervedneſs, or by Suffering his Tongue to run Counter to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and by a thouſand ſeign'd ſtrategems amuſe his Enemy, and delude the Vigilance of Spies, till a favourable overture ſhall occur, which poſſibly may not be above once or twice in a Campaigne, and ſuch too as may not be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47781:85"/>
but of a Momentary Duration. He muſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Courage of his Soldiers, and teach them to endure Watchfulneſs, Hunger, and all manner of hardſhips by his own Example, with infinite other Acts and Habits of Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Temperance and Prudence: None of which can ever conſiſt with one who Frolicks in a Debauch, and has his Brains intoxicated with Drink, which renders him Talkative, Huffiſh, and uncapable of Conſidering, and his Body alſo uncapable of Action and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips; and where ſuch Intemperance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes habitual, it renders the Perſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it Crazy, and fitter for an Hoſpital than a Camp.</p>
               <p>Ale-Houſes and Taverns are not the only Places, in which Men practiſe this Exerciſe of Debauchery. In an Ale-Houſe 'tis true; they Act as in a Theatre open to the Eyes of all; and the Circumſtances of ſuch Places being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſtinking and naſty, are alone ſufficient to render the frequenting of them moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and infamous: Whereas they who fud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in their own Private Houſes, ſeeming to Act behind the Curtain, are altogether as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable as the former; the very Quinteſcence or Poyſon rather of the Sin conſiſting in the abuſe or ſuperfluous waſte of thoſe Bleſſings, which might ſerve for the Relief of ſuch as are ready to periſh with Cold and Hunger. As for Drunkenneſs, or that Giddineſs of Brain which attends Exceſs with all the Concomitant Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, they are indeed but ſome part of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47781:85"/>
Puniſhment due thereunto, it ſeeming good to the All-wiſe God to annex Pain to Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in all Caſes almoſt whatſoever. When I have ſeen a Man of Fortune, as they call him, rouling in his Coach, and making a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to his ſeveral Poſts and Preferments, and meeting the Careſſes and Complements of his Acquaintance, in all Places where he comes; when I have conſidered in what Eaſe and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury he lives, riſing perhaps about Nine or Ten a Clock, and it may be is at the pains to take a little breathing-Walk to whet his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for a Feaſt; when I ſee him ſtuff his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs with fat Veniſon, and Claret, till the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Seams of it are ready to burſt, and after Dinner dozing and ſmoaking his Pipe with great Grace and Gravity: When I have ſeen all this, I ſay, I have been upon the point of envying ſuch a Man's Happineſs; when, lo! upon a ſudden, Oh! I feel a Pain in my Foot, an intolerable and unexpected Pain! Good Man! all muſt needs be mightily concern'd for him, and the Town and Country muſt ring of this great and ſudden Diſaſter. The Houſe is alarm'd, the Doctor, or Apothecary, with other Dependants and Retainers to the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are ſent for in poſt-haſt; and after a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Examination of the Matter by the whole Conſult, without ſtirring from the Place, they give in their Verdict, that it is the Gout: And now perhaps my Grandee begins a little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon his former Life, and would gladly change States of Body with him who lives on
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47781:86"/>
mouldy Bread and Cheeſe all the Week, and whoſe Drink perhaps is from the next Brook, or but one degree beyond Water.</p>
               <p>The like Obſervations might be made upon other Extravagancies, ſuch as Whoring, with all that Train of fatal Diſaſters which follow all Exceſs of our Paſſions, whether of Deſire, Envy, Revenge, Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are inſeparably accompanied with ſuch a Degree of Pain or Puniſhment, as far exceeds the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Pleaſures of any Intemperance, and is infinitely more laſting; ſo that <hi>Quo quis pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat Eodem punitur,</hi> is a Motto which ought to be engraven upon every Man's Heart, being univerſally true in all manner of Diſorders whatſoever.</p>
               <p>I have been told Abroad by ſome German Gentlemen, that it was a uſual thing amongſt them, in the Warmth of their Debauches, (which in thoſe Countries are exceſſive) to drink their Healths out of the Barrel of a cock'd and loaded Piſtol, with Finger on the Triquer, whilſt they diſcharge the Wine into their Throats; ſo that upon the leaſt Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of an unſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ady Hand, the Bullet would not fail to do its Duty. This Point of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very being over, they all give a Volly on fire together, and then charge afreſh, and ſo on. If this kind of Gallantry were in vogue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, I believe we ſhould have fewer Drunkards than now there are, and by going out of this World by a Draught of Flame, they would be better prepar'd to drink of it for ever in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:47781:86"/>
But whilſt ſome Countries indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Infernal or Stygian Recreation, we have Examples of Sobriety in others; ſo that the <hi>French,</hi> ſo extravagant as they are in ſome things, in this Particular, may juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us for not following their Mode, as they do for following them in others; there being very few Gentlemen amongſt them to be found who drink betwixt Meals, and even at their Meat they drink their Wine above half mix'd with Water, more or leſs, according to every Man's private Palate, and ſometimes Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcolour'd only with a little Roſie-Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Wine: And yet we do not find but that theſe Men have almoſt as much Mettle and Bravery in them as any Brandy-Hero whatſoever. Each Country has its National Vices as well as Vertues, whilſt he who would acquire the Character of a Gallant Man, ought ſo to follow their Examples, as to propoſe what is good and commendable in them for his Imitation and Practiſe, declining their ill Cuſtoms as Things which bring Diſeſteem and Miſery in the end.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Abuſes of Inns or Ale-houſes, it is too well known what all Men ſuffer from their cheating Meaſures: Their Quart-Pots or Flagons, their Juggs, their Muggs, their Jacks, their Carmikins, their Beakers, their Tum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lers, their Glaſs-Bottles, their Tankards, and above all, their Silver-Tankards, tho' all of them be pretty little Curioſities, yet are they moſt groſs Cheats, not containing above a true Pint and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47781:87"/>
a half; ſo that in Four Shillings expended this way, One is pure Couſenage. Much better were it, if their Meaſures (after the Cuſtom of other well polic'd Countries) were mark'd and ſeal'd, and reduc'd to a Standard all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> over, as our Weights are over all the World: Whereas in a paltry Ale-houſe a ſmall, ſlender-waſted Flagon, with a broad empty bottom, and with ſides, back, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruſh'd almoſt together, and capp'd half way with Froth, goes down very glibly with my bonny Cuſtomer at two or three Gulps; and when Good-fellows are upon the Quill of Drinking, the Strength and Capacity of the Man is much eſteem'd by the Number of Flagons; whereas the ſilly Sot, perhaps, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drank half that quantity, for which he ſets ſo high a Value upon himſelf, and pays ſo dearly.</p>
               <p>The like Cheats we meet with daily from the traſhy Ingredients of ſophiſticated Liquors, which many times does advance them double or treble in the Price, when really they are much beneath the Plain Drinks for Health and Goodneſs; nor are we to forget the hard Names with which many Liquors are baptiz'd; which puts me in mind of what I have ſometime heard of a Two-Pot Knave, who being out of Reputation for Drink, or (to ſpeak in the Language of a Tapſter) being at the loweſt Stoop, and on the very Dreggs and Lees of his Profeſſion, was advis'd to make <hi>Daucus-Ale,</hi> which he chriſtned <hi>Blan-Carote.</hi> This

dainty new Name, by the help of ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Waggs of his Acquaintance, was cry'd up for a curious Outlandiſh, <hi>Low-Country</hi> Drink; and this was ſufficient to give it Credit, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Cuſtom to my honeſt Draw-Cauſor, that in a ſhort time after, he became very rich, and was at the leaſt a Squire's Fellow, and, for ought I know, ſomething better. But ſuch Cheats as theſe are rather to be wink'd at than puniſh'd; for I know no Law which can oblige a Magiſtrate to put Brains into the Heads of Fools; and to put them all into <hi>Bedlam</hi> who fall under this Character, would be very troubleſome: Let them reſt merry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for their own and for others Diverſion, till they fall irrecoverably into the Hands of the Catch-pole.</p>
               <p>In ſumm, 'Tis the Buſineſs of a Reſolute and Sober Magiſtrate to Reform Notorious Diſorders, by Puniſhing the Offenders, and by Suppreſſing ſuch Houſes as are uſeleſs; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting only in greater Towns ſome Publick Inns to ſerve the Occaſions of Travellers, and of the Market; and upon the Occaſions like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Fairs, to allow Private Houſes a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſell Drink: For by this means, Inns will become well accommodated, and not as now, being (by reaſon of their great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) ready to eat, or rather to drink, one another. In greater Towns and Cities, a greater Number or Proportion is to be allow'd. If Gentlemen likewiſe, and eſpecially Juſtices of the Peace, would withdraw themſelves

from theſe ſcandalous Places, unleſs oblig'd thereunto by Urgent or Publick Occaſions, Sobriety would by degrees get ground, and others alſo be invited to follow their Good Examples: And as for Inns up and down the Country Roads, 'twere well if they gave good creditable Security and Caution to the Bench, for their honeſt Demeanour, better than what is uſually taken in theſe Caſes; and if a more watchful Eye were kept over them, from time to time; ſo that by theſe and other Prudent Methods, the Buſineſs of the Country would thrive and proſper, whilſt they who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to follow it are reduc'd to the Rules of Temperance and Frugality.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:47781:88"/>
The Firſt were ſuch as were <hi>Servi</hi> by Nature and Birth, as all thoſe who were begotten on Bondwomen, Handmaids, or Harlots, or came of Parents of baſe and ſervile Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Of this kind we read of ſome in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Patriarchs of old, as alſo under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. where the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Bondmen and Bondwomen, which were not of the Stock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (for they were not allow'd to have Bond-Servants of their own Tribes) were look'd upon as their proper Inheritance, and to be accounted as Bondmen and Bondwomen for ever. Amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> likewiſe, ſuch as were born of Bondwomen were call'd <hi>Vernae,</hi> in oppoſition to ſuch as were by Birth call'd <hi>Ingenui,</hi> or Free-born; which Cuſtom ſtill had a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Regard to the Woman, if ſhew were of baſe and ſervile Condition: For, by the Civil Law, if a Woman were a <hi>Serva,</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free, the Iſſue were accounted Servile, or Slaves; as on the contrary, if a Man of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Condition and Quality did beget a Child on the Body of a Free-woman, the Iſſue was look'd upon as Free-born: Hence came that Maxim of <hi>Partus Sequitur Ventrem,</hi> for we are more ſure of the Mother than of the Father; and herein the Civil Law is directly contrary to our <hi>Norman</hi> or Ancient Cuſtoms: And 'tis not improbable, that <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf a Baſtard, and of baſe Blood by the Mother's ſide, thought good to meaſure the Pre-eminence of Birth from the Father's ſide.</p>

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:47781:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
A Second ſort of Servants and Slaves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ancients, were ſuch as were <hi>Servi Jure Gentium,</hi> as being taken Priſoners in War; it being ever adjudg'd Juſt, by the Laws of Nations, that ſuch Priſoners ſhould become Servants or Slaves to thoſe who ſpar'd their Lives; and hence it was that by the <hi>Romans</hi> they were call'd <hi>Servi quaſi ſervati,</hi> foraſmuch as they were ſav'd, I ſay, when by the Law of War they might have been kill'd. Of this kind the <hi>Jews</hi> had none, for they were ſtill requir'd to kill their Enemies, without Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a thing indeed which to us ſeems very harſh, and repugnant to the Dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Laws of Humanity, which teach us to do to others what we would that they ſhould do to us: No leſs contrary was their Behaviour in this Particular to the Practice of all Nations beſides. We read indeed of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> that by Stratagem they circumvented the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> and that they ever liv'd amongſt them as Slaves or Bondmen.</p>
               <p>A Third ſort of Servants, who, by the Civil Law likewiſe were accounted <hi>Servi</hi> or Slaves, were ſuch, who, tho' born free, yet ſold or hir'd themſelves to others for a certain Term, either of Years or Life. This was practis'd amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> where we read of ſome that were hir'd only for a Year, and ſome for a longer Term, and theſe amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were diſtinguiſh'd from Bondmen: For of their own Tribes, by the God, none could be a Bondman, tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47781:89"/>
Servants for a Term of Time; and this was frequently practis'd by poor Debtors with their Creditors, which poor Debtors God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be treated not as Bond-ſervants, but as hired Servants or Sojourners, with Gentleneſs and not with Rigour, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. and that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> when Liberty was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd to the Captive, they were to be ſet free; tho' <hi>Bodin</hi> tells us, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. that ſuch Servants or Debtors, were, by the Law of God, to be releas'd upon the Return of the Seventh Year, which was accounted Holy, and call'd <hi>a Sabbath of Years;</hi> at which time alſo all hired Servants were to be at Liberty. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Law is our Cuſtom grounded of binding Apprentices for Seven Years.</p>
               <p>And here by the way a Queſtion may be ſtarted, whether ſuch an Apprentice, by being ſold, or made a Bondman, for Seven Years, tho' deſcended of Gentile Parentage, does not forfeit the Privileges of his Blood? For tho' he be not a Slave, ſuch as were thoſe amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet being bound or ſold into a State of Servitude, he thereby renounces actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that Liberty or Freedom which is eſſential to a Gentleman: So that in <hi>France, Germany, Italy,</hi> and in the Northern Parts, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, where the Civil Law is in force, the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> only excepted, 'tis rarely ſeen that Gentlemen, tho' never ſo low in Fortune, will bind their Children Apprentices, nor make any Affinity with Merchants, tho' never ſo rich, unleſs they firſt purchaſe Honours
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47781:90"/>
and quit their Traffick. Whereas, with us in <hi>England,</hi> we ſee the contrary every Day, foraſmuch as we are not under the Directions of the Civil Law which entails ſuch Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon Blood. Nay, and what is yet more remarkable, the Nobility do not only conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to make an Affinity and Relation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Shops; but the Shop-keepers themſelves, even Retailers, and ſometimes meer Merchants, are inroll'd amongſt the Nobility, or Orders of Knighthood; a thing which at the firſt bluſh looks a little Heterodox, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſee the Blew-Apron intitled to the Sword.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Jews:</hi> It was a Cuſtom or Law with them likewiſe, that in caſe a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould preferr his Maſter's Service before Liberty, he was to be brought before the Judges, and to have his Ear bor'd through with an Awl by his Maſter at the Door-Poſt of his Houſe, and ſo he became his Servant for ever: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, in caſe he liv'd to the Year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> he was to be ſet at Liberty, as moſt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters agree, unleſs he ſhould chooſe rather to ſerve a ſecond time.</p>
               <p>A Fourth ſort of Servants or Slaves were thoſe as were called <hi>Servi Poenae,</hi> or ſuch as were condemn'd to the Mines and Galleys, of which kind we have many in theſe our Days: And of this kind likewiſe are thoſe with us who are adjudg'd to Publick Work-Houſes, or <hi>Bridewells.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fifth and laſt kind of Servants or Slaves, were thoſe who were ſold by Robbers
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47781:90"/>
or Pirates, and might, <hi>bona fide,</hi> be poſſeſſed by thoſe who purchas'd them, unleſs they knew them to be free; tho' by the Civil Law a Pyrate or Robber cannot diveſt a Freeman of his Liberty, however he may confine him in his Perſon, and force him as his Slave. To this Head likewiſe we may reduce all thoſe who were of old ſold by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and ſent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> as thoſe likewiſe who at this Day are ſold Yearly by the ſame <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> to the <hi>Turks</hi> in great Droves; as thoſe Blacks alſo of <hi>Guinea,</hi> in which our Merchants drive ſo Conſiderable a Trade.</p>
               <p>The Power which Maſters formerly had over their Servants or Slaves was very great: Amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> 'tis true, this Power of Maſters was reſtrain'd and limited by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> Law; for they had no Bond-Servants or Slaves, as I ſaid before: Only poor Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors might pawn their Service, and theſe were to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ated with all Mercy and Gentleneſs: And as to their hired Servants, in caſe a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by his over-Severity, ſhould ſmite one of them with a Rod, that he died, the Maſter ſurely was to be puniſh'd, but not to be put to Death for it, as I conceive; and in caſe of a Maim, he was to let his Servant go free; but in caſe a Servant continued ill for a Day or two, by means of his Maſter's Correction, the Maſter was not to be puniſh'd, for ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was his Money.</p>
               <p>But amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> 'twas far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: For there the Maſter or Patron had a full
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47781:91"/>
Power over the Life of his Servant, without the Cognizance of the Magiſtrate; inſomuch that <hi>Aſenius Pollio</hi> having invited <hi>Auguſtus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time to Supper, condemn'd his Servant to be caſt into a Pool or Lake, to be Food for the Lampreys, which he kept there in ſtore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he chanc'd to break a Cryſtal Glaſs; nor would <hi>Pollio,</hi> by the Interceſſion of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> be prevail'd upon to ſpare his Servant's Life. If at any time it happen'd that the Patron or Maſter of the Family was found murder'd in his Houſe, all the Servants living under his Roof, tho' never ſo innocent, were inſtantly to be put to Death: Of which Cruelty we have a very Remarkable Example in <hi>Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> Praefect of <hi>Rome;</hi> for, as <hi>Tacitus (Lib.</hi> 14.) reports, Great Interceſſion was made by the common People of <hi>Rome</hi> (who for the moſt part conſiſted of Libertines, or ſuch as being ſometimes Servants themſelves had been made free,) on the Behalf of the guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eſs Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but all to little purpoſe: For, after the Debate of the Senate, it was reſolv'd, That the Cuſtom of their Anceſtors ſhould be kept inviolable; whereupon, without more ado, than with <hi>a more majorum,</hi> all the Servants in his Family, being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Four Hundred, were put to Death: Nay, ſo little did the <hi>Romans</hi> value the Lives of their Slaves or Servants, that many times they commanded them to encounter with wild Beaſts, or with one another, in the open Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, purely for Divertiſement and Paſtime,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47781:91"/>
under the Shew of Bravery and Courage. 'Tis true, the <hi>Petronian</hi> Law forbad innocent Servants to be caſt to wild Beaſts. <hi>Nero</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and after him <hi>Hadrian,</hi> as <hi>Spartian</hi> tells us, appointed Judges to hear the Complaints of Servants, who at the Will and Pleaſure of their Patrons were condemn'd to die: But all theſe Proviſions were ſuperceded by the more Ancient Cuſtom, which plac'd a Power of Life and Death in the Will and Pleaſure of their Maſters.</p>
               <p>This Arbitrary, and Unlimited Power in the Patrons or Maſters made their Servants or Slaves take Sanctuary at the Temples and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their Gods: But neither the Statues of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> nor the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> which King <hi>Servius</hi> appointed as an Aſylum for Servants; nor the Statue of <hi>Romulus,</hi> appointed by the Senate for this End and Purpoſe, could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford any Protection, no more than the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of <hi>Theſeus</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> or the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Tho' <hi>Tiberius</hi> (as my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Bodin</hi> obſerves) with great Policy caus'd his own Statue to be erected as an Aſylum for fugitive Servants, withal menacing Death to any who ſhould take ſuch Servants from thence; and this the ſubtile Tyrant did, not for the Good and Safety of ſuch Servants, but with Deſign that they might more eaſily be tempted to conſpire againſt their Maſters; and thus he kept the Maſters under Awe and ſlaviſh O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience by the Protection he gave their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Upon the like Score it was that <hi>Sylla,</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:47781:92"/>
having proſcris'd or baniſh'd Sixty Thouſand Citizens, the better to conſummate his helliſh Villany and Cruelty, animated the Servants to cut the Throats of their Maſters, with the Promiſe of Liberty; amongſt whom, one bringing the Head of his Maſter to <hi>Sylla,</hi> he kept his Promiſe; for he manumis'd him, or made him free, but withal commanded him to be thrown down headlong from the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock or Precipice, the uſual Puniſhment for condemn'd Perſons, as a Reward juſtly due to ſuch a Traitor.</p>
               <p>No wonder then if Jealouſies aroſe betwixt Maſters and Servants, which broke forth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards into dreadful Tumults, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with infinite Treacheries and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for at one and the ſame time, in all the Cities belonging to <hi>Italy, Meſſana</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the Servants conſpired againſt their Maſters: And afterwards, in the time of <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> above 60000 Servants took up Arms at once, under the Command of one <hi>Spartacus,</hi> a bold Slave and a <hi>Gladiator,</hi> and put three Armies of the <hi>Romans</hi> to flight: For ſo it was, that the Number of Servants or Slaves was ten times greater than that of thoſe who were born free; inſomuch that <hi>M. Craſſus</hi> himſelf numbred no leſs than 500 belonging to him, beſides ſuch as attended always on his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Concerns. And that there might be ſome Diſtinction made betwixt Servants and thoſe who were born free, it was debated in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Senate, That all Servants ſhould wear
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47781:92"/>
one certain Badge or Habit; but this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was laid aſide by the more prudent Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of one of the Senators, ſaying, <hi>that by this means the Servants would be able to know their own Numbers and Strength, and ſo be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cut their Patrons Throats.</hi> Hence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Capital for any Servants to carry Arms, as it is at this day in <hi>Paris</hi> for Lacqueys, ſince the Tumult raiſed there of above Twenty Thouſand armed Lacqueys, which put that City under a great Conſternation, upon the Execution of a Criminal who wore a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>But amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> in caſe of any Urgent Neceſſity, they firſt made their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants free, and then arm'd them: Thus did <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47781:93"/>
were fifty thouſand Horſemen, were all Slaves. Now becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> never truſted their Slaves with their Arms, the better to prevent Diſorders, they employ'd them in ſome Manual Occupation or Trade, which by the Inſtitution of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> it was not lawful for Free Citizens to profeſs. And yet for all this, we find that in their Civil Wars, their Slaves would ſtill quit their Maſters, and ſide with one Party or the other, in hopes to better their Fortunes; ſo that <hi>Augustus</hi> after the War fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> took no leſs than Thirty Thouſand of them Priſoners, all which, for adhering to <hi>Pompey,</hi> were delivered over to their reſpective Maſters, to be put to Death by them for their Deſertion, and ſuch whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Patrons were already deceas'd, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with commanded to be hang'd.</p>
               <p>And ſuch truly was the Number of theſe Servants or Slaves in the Chriſtian Empire, that when <hi>Mahomet</hi> revolted in <hi>Arabia,</hi> he ſent his Embaſſador <hi>Homarus</hi> to proclaim liberty to all Servants or Slaves who ſhould follow his Standard: Whereupon ſuch a vaſt Number of them throng'd from all Quarters, that he ſoon ſubdu'd the faireſt Provinces of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Empire. This Succeſs of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Slaves ſoon invited the <hi>Europeans</hi> to rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Patrons: For about the Year 781, the Servants in <hi>Spain</hi> took up Arms for their Liberty, as likewiſe in <hi>France</hi> about the time of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Laws againſt the Conjuration

               <p>In ſum, as ſoon as the Chriſtian Religion began to triumph over <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> there was a Door opened for a greater Liberty, which was made much wider by <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which forbad any of his own Religion to be Slaves.

However, in the time of <hi>Bartolus,</hi> who livd about the Year 1300, there were no Slaves or Servants of the Ancient Stamp to be any where found; and <hi>Lewis Hutin,</hi> about the Year 1313, manumis'd all Servants through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Kingdom, for a certain Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which, as the Learned <hi>Bodin</hi> interprets, muſt be underſtood of ſuch Libertines as were called <hi>Mortmains</hi> in former Ages, who by me Prince's Indulgence were releas'd from that Bond of Servitude by which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from marrying, or alienating their Goods out of their Patrons Territories.</p>
               <p>The Right and Title which Patrons of old had to their Slaves or Servants, was as great and unqueſtionable as that which they had to their Lands and Houſes, or any other Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever; inſomuch that neither the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, at the Requeſt of the People, nor yet the Authority of the Emperor, could ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate or extinguiſh that Authority which a Maſter had over his Servant, or make him Free without his Conſent: Nay, the Emperor had not Power to beſtow a Ring of Gold, which was a ſort of Military Reward, and conferrd uſually as a Badge of Gratuity upon thoſe who deſerv'd well of the Prince; I ſay, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had not Power to beſtow ſuch a Gift upon a Libertine, without the Conſent of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47781:94"/>
Patron; inſomuch as <hi>Commodus</hi> commanded all the Gold Rings to be taken from off the Hands of thoſe who had been rewarded with them without their Patrons Leave. So that by the Imperial Laws, no Prejudice could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Patron by ſuch Rewards, although a Prince ſhould reſtore a Servant to his Birth-right, or that State in which he was born, which Prerogative was ſolely in the Prince.</p>
               <p>The way of making Slaves free was by a Box on the Ear, which the Maſter gave the Servant as a Farewel-ſtroke to his Servitude. This was call'd <hi>Manumiſing;</hi> and then the Maſter beſtowing on him a Tufted Cap to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſhav'd Crown, he was reputed a <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or Freed-man; ſo that <hi>ad Pileam vocare</hi> was us'd as a Phraſe amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> to ſignifie a Man's Advancement into a State of Liberty: For Slaves always were ſhav'd, and went bare-headed, as it is at this Day us'd by the <hi>Turks.</hi> And for this Reaſon likewiſe 'twas, that Prieſts heretofore, and at this Day in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, wear their Heads ſhav'd, to ſhew, that they are wholly dedicated as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or Slaves to the Service of God. The <hi>Pileus</hi> or Cap then was a Badge of Liberty; and for this Reaſon 'twas that <hi>Brutus</hi> caus'd his Medals to be ſtamp'd on the Reverſe with a Cap betwixt two Ponyards, thereby ſignifying the Liberty which was procur'd to the People of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Blow which <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from his Dagger.</p>

For notwithſtanding the Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Reports of ſome, none doubts in Reaſon but that they are, notwithſtanding their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, of the ſame Species with Whites, and have Souls to be ſav'd as well as others.

acknowledg'd, in the firſt place, that they are the Inſtruments, or rather the Hands, by which the good Husbandman does ſubſiſt and live: So that he who has the good Fortune to meet with ſuch as are Faithful, has found, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, one of the greateſt Bleſſings of which this Life is capable; as on the contrary, he that ſhall rely on ſuch as are Lazy, Waſtful, and Falſe, needs no other Curſe to make him miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and let the Maſter be never ſo Honeſt, Laborious, and Prudent, he ſhall never proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the World whilſt they are in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Men of more plentiful Fortunes and Credit have an Advantage over Servants and Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, eſpecially if ſuch Maſters be Men in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; becauſe 'tis oftentimes in their Power to humble them, or to do them good: For ſuch is the Temper of a baſe and ſervile Nature ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, as renders it inſenſible of Obligation, or Courteſie, Men of this Character caring lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le for any, but upon the aforeſaid Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. Hence it is that Great Men do in a manner command the Services and Labours of others, and a Right Worſhipful ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want Hands when his Occaſions ſhall call for them. As for a Gentleman of the Fourth or Fifth Rate, or thoſe of about a Hundred <hi>per Annum,</hi> they are, probably, in the worſt Poſt of any to reap Advantage from ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: So that I dare be bold to ſay, that a Yeoman-like Man, of about Forty or Fifty Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> ſhall keep a better Houſe,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47781:98"/>
and lie warmer than the former: For a Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man goes himſelf and works with his Servants; ſo that there is not only the Labour of one Hireling ſav'd, but the Good Man being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Company with his Workmen, he is ſure to have a Pennyworth, and to ſee his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs go forward; and 'tis very well known too, that Servants will of themſelves work much more heartily when the Maſter partakes with them in the Labour, than when they are left to themſelves. Moreover, ſuch a good Husbandman buying or ſelling all things him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and looking to all his Cattle and Tack of Husbandry with his own Eyes, or being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employ'd in his own Affairs, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive Prejudice from the Ignorance, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and Falſhood of Servants, which I am confident amounts to one Third of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; ſo that he muſt needs ſuffer, and that very conſiderably, in his Intereſt, were he to truſt all his Concerns with others. Whereas a Gentleman, unleſs he be ſuch a one as has been bred up to the Plow, cannot labour with his own Hands, nor may he go to Market to ſell his own Corn, forſooth; and if he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to buy or ſell Cattle himſelf, 'tis five to one but he is over-reach'd; and if he lies within Doors, or follows his Recreations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, 'tis the ſame Odds, that his Servants neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his Buſineſs, or attend their own, <hi>viz.</hi> to filtch and cheat him.</p>
               <p>Servants or Labourers are of two ſorts, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, and ſuch as live by the Year, or ſuch
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47781:98"/>
as we commonly call Day-Labourers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Carpenters, Maſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or other poor Men which we employ about our Husbandry. I begin with Domeſticks, who certainly are as much debas'd in their Duty, as they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in themſelves beyond what they were at in former Times. Forty Years ago, Three Pounds Ten Shillings was the Wages of a good Bailiff, or Capital Hind; as likewiſe Forty or Fifty Shillings of a young Fellow: But now their Wages is riſen One third, at leaſt. The Reaſon hereof can be no other than the waſtful manner of Living amongſt many of our Gentry, who abandoning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Drinking, Feaſting, fine Apparel, Furniture, and ſuperfluous Retinue; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Vanity of exceſſive giving to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at one anothers Houſes, there is ſuch an Emulation amongſt them, who ſhall ſpend his Eſtate moſt nobly, as they call it, that even the very Servants themſelves will ape their Maſters in riotous Living and Exceſs, and are as modiſh in their Habits; ſo that in former Ages they would have been miſtaken (God bleſs 'em!) for Gentlemen of the Firſt Order. To maintain which Vanity, they muſt advance their Wages, which, inſtead of making them more Thankful and Diligent, does but render them commonly more Diſobedient and Proud. To remedy which Diſorders, nothing can be more helpful than good Sumptuary Laws, confining every Man to live in a modeſt <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> according to his Condition and Quality,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47781:99"/>
and, above all, reducing Servants to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Frugal Habit: For a Clown, certainly, and a draggle-tail'd Kitchen-Wench, when trick'd up like my Maſter and Lady, cannot chooſe but have a mighty Opinion of their own Merit and Improvements. The Cat, when ſhe was dreſs'd out of the Wardrobe of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſate at Table with the State and Demure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Virgin-Bride; but as ſoon as a Mouſe croſs'd the Room, Puſs forgets her Majeſty, and running eagerly upon the Prey, ſhew'd her ſelf to be a pure ravenous Animal, and fit only to live on Vermine. A paltry Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, which came but juſt now all perfum'd from emptying and cleanſing the Veſſels of the Chamber, ſhall appear at Table in her Flower'd Manteau, and her tottering Commode, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth; but notwithſtanding all, upon every trivial Accident and Turn, will not fail to ſhew her ſelf to be a meer errant Cat, deſtin'd by Nature to feed on meaner Fare.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the many Knaveries of Servants there is one trickiſh piece which they uſually put in practice, <hi>viz.</hi> When a Servant's Year draws towards an end, without giving Notice of his Intentions to his Maſter, he hunts about for a freſh Service, and when he had found a Place where he can advance his Wages, he hires himſelf by taking Earneſt; and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Tis very true, the Laws of our Kingdom have made a good Proviſion againſt ſuch Cheats, forbidding all Perſons to hire any Servant without a Diſcharge from his former Maſter, or at leaſt a Certificate from the Pariſh he has liv'd in, of his Honeſty and good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; ſo that he who hires a Perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a Cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For ſhould a Man ſtand upon the Niceties of the Statute, he might ſooner ſtarve than be furniſh'd with a Servant.

               <p>To this End and Purpoſe it would be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that no Servant, I mean ſuch as are to be imploy'd in Husbandry, ſhould be ſuffer'd to hire himſelf in any other County than that he was born in: For by this means the Actions of his Life would eaſily be inſpected, and the Servant himſelf be prevented from wandring like a Vagabond, eſcaping the Puniſhment due to the Rogueries he might commit in one County, by ſhifting into another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It would be very expedient like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that of Servants, againſt whom there is ſufficient Proof made of their ill Behaviour, there ſhould be a Record or Memorandum of ſuch Offences entred into a Regiſter, and to be kept by the Church-Wardens of every Pariſh: For by this means they would be ſtill bridled from playing the Rogue. And, in the laſt place, 'twould be expedient that it might have the Power of the Bench at their Seſſions, or rather of the Judges in their reſpective Circuits, to limit and determine the Wages of Hinds for the Purpoſes, not to exceed Four Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and of others proportionably, making
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47781:100"/>
all Tranſgreſſions of ſuch an Order, whether Maſters or Servants, to be obnoxious to a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. Theſe Three Points duly executed, would quickly make the Servants honeſt and induſtrious, and fit conſequently to be truſted: By theſe means likewiſe the Maſters would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wealthy, and able to provide for their Families, and ſupply the Publick Exigence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion; and in like manner the Servants themſelves, when married, would betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their honeſt Labour, and thereby provide for their Wives and Children, and for themſelves too in Time of Sickneſs and Old Age, and not leave themſelves a Burden upon the Pariſh, nor liable to be proſecuted for ill Courſes, as being bred up Strangers to them in their youthful Days: For he who has been a waſtful, pilfering, or idle Servant, will never make an honeſt Labourer in his declining Years, but go on from Roguery to Roguery; as on the other hand, one who has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Frugality, and has been found true when a Servant, will have ſomething to help them forwards in the World, by taking of a Farm, and by his former Actions gain Truſt with his Landlord, and Credit in his Dealings.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Rewards ſometimes are found to have as great, or a greater Force upon ſome Natures than Puniſhments, it might not be improper if ſome Privileges or honorary Marks were conferr'd upon ſuch Servants as ſhould continue Seven Years in a Service, the ſame
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47781:101"/>
being to be entered into the Pariſh-Regiſter, for the Reputation and future Advantage of ſuch Servants; ſuch Memorandums, Gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Privileges, being a good Fund of Credit upon which Servants might begin the World; it being no way to be doubted, but that one who has liv'd ſome Years in a Service, will uſe his utmoſt Endeavours, by a faithful and diligent Behaviour, to preſerve to the End of ſuch a Term of Years as would be ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to him.</p>
               <p>Labourers, whether Artfiicers, or ſuch as drudge in Husbandry at Day-wages, are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Servants, as being hir'd at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Price to labour for us. The Tricks and Shifts of Workmen are too many to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſpoken to: Therefore they who deal with ſuch, ought to be cautious and prudent. 'Tis the common Uſe of Workmen to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more than they ever intend or are able to perform; and this they do that they may have many Strings to their Bow, to ſerve them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions, which infallibly puts them upon a Neceſſity of breaking their Words for ſeveral times, perhaps, one after another, and of leaving what they undertake unfiniſh'd, frequently to the great Damage of thoſe who are concern'd with them. In which caſe a Man muſt hold his Tongue within his Teeth; for to proſecute their Neglect, would be ſuch an Alarm to others of the ſame Profeſſion, that a Man might very well reſt aſſur'd with himſelf, never to get any of this kind to come
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47781:101"/>
hear him; for uſually they all combine and hang together.</p>
               <p>There is one Notorious and Common Cheat practis'd by all Labourers, or Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſuch as Carpenters or Maſons, I mean in the Countries, who uſually hire ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond or indigent Boys or Fellows, which they call Journeymen or Labourers: Theſe, the moſt ignorant of their Trade muſt have Wages, as tho they had ſerv'd an Apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſo that 'tis common, and I have found, and do daily find by Experience, That a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall take up half a Starv'd Rogues and Boys to ſerve them, ſubducting clandeſtinely Two Pence a day out of their Wages pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the purpoſe, that they pay a Boy Six Pence <hi>per diem,</hi> and receive the ſame of their Maſters, when by under-hand Contract they pay ſuch Boys but a Groat, and ſo of Men-Labourers: So that a Maſon or Carpenter ſhall by this way of Cheating, get his Half Crown a Day, if he has many Underlings: And when ſuch Boys or Labourers are tired with their Slavery, they pick up other lazy and Indigent Vagabonds, who being ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Maintenance, pilfer and watch all opportunities of ſtealing where-ever they are entertained. 'Twould be very prudently done therefore, if the Gentlemen of the Bench would have a more eſpecial Eye to this Abuſe, and 'twere to be wiſh'd that they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd to ſettle Apprentices upon ſuch Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices as are moſt neceſſary for the Country, a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47781:102"/>
Plowrights, Carpenters, Maſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo there might be ſome train'd up ſtill to ſerve the Country in theſe neceſſary Occaſions, whereas Maſons, Plowrights, and the like, rarely take Apprentices, that ſo they may keep the Husbandman in continual depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on them, and engroſs all to themſelves, ſo that a Man may hunt ſome Miles many times, and wait many Weeks for ſuch ſort of Engineers, and Court and Sneek, for fear of diſpleaſing them: And when any ſuch kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Workman chance to die, there's a mortal Breach or Gap made in all Country Buſineſs; ſo that a Man's Husbandry may cool upon his hands before he ſhall have the good Fortune to be reliev'd.</p>
               <p>There are four ſorts of Labourers, who when hir'd by the Day-labour for 12 or 14 <hi>d. per diem,</hi> as the Work is, or as the Rates run commonly in the Country in which they live; and yet the ſame men when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Work by Task, ſhall gain twice as much in a day; which ſhews plainly, that when they wrought by the day, they did not exert half their Strength and Labour; a notorious piece of knavery and deceit. I do not much approve therefore of hiring Men by Task, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Work be ſuch as depends upon many ſubordinate and inferiour Workmen of divers. kinds; as in Building, Projecting and the like, where the Head-Undertaker muſt be ſuppos'd to have a greater Inſight into all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depending than an ordinary private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can pretend to, and therefore if a Man be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47781:102"/>
diligent in computing his Charge, and wary in making his Bargain, he may eaſe himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably of a great Trouble and Expence, which he will not fail to meet with in chaffering eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day at the Workmen of ſeveral Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which muſt needs be a Buſineſs of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and Vexation.</p>
               <p>But my Buſineſs at preſent concerns ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as we commonly call Day-Labourers; as <hi>Hedgers, Ditchers, Thraſhers, Wood-cutters,</hi> with ſuch-like ſervile Labourers as are more nearly concern'd with the honeſt Farmer or Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And here I think my Obſervation does not fail me, <hi>viz.</hi> that in times of greateſt Plenty, Labourers are in greateſt ſcarcity; for ſo it is, that lazy Fellows (and ſuch common Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are for the moſt part, they eſpecially of the baſer ſort) can in times of Plenty main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves for a Week, perhaps, with Three Days Labour: For generally ſuch ſort of Cattle will work only from Hand to Mouth, knowing, that in caſe of Old Age, Sickneſs, or Increaſe of Children, the Pariſh muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them; and if they have at any time Six Pence in Bank, the next Ale-houſe lays an Embargo on it; or if we be in an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of their Labour, we muſt purchaſe it at extraordinary Rates. Now this is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Ruine of the Husbandman, <hi>viz.</hi> To give moſt to hire Labourers, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Earth yield him the leaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and what is yet worſe, the Number of Poor encreaſes. For few will labour when the Earth yields them Food for nothing,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47781:103"/>
which Obſervation may be yet farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd from hence; that the moſt fertile and plentiful Countries are ever ſtock'd with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds and Beggars, whilſt the hungry and barren parts have no Entertainment for ſuch unprofitable Vermin, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>equently the Inhabitants grow rich (or at leaſt are not poor.)</p>
               <p>To remedy which Evil there can be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way than for the Juſtices of the Peace, once every Year, to regulate the Rates and Wages of ſuch Labourers, according as the Profits and Productions of the Earth ſhall ebb or flow, as alſo ſeverely to puniſh ſuch nuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Fellows as ſhall neglect their daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: For the Rule of the Civil Law is moſt certainly true, <hi>That it is for the Welfare and Intereſt of the Commonwealth, that every man ſhould make a good uſe of his time, and of his own propriety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are another ſort of wandring Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or Merchants-Errant, as Journey-men Taylors, Journey-men Shoemakers, and the like, which wandring from Country to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are entertained in Towns and Country-Villages, where theſe Gentlemen ſtay uſually no longer than till they can make an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Neighbouring Grounds, Shops or Stables, and then away march theſe Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Gentle-Craft, and renew their Trade in ſome other Country, and ſo on to the end of their Lives, unleſs they fall perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, into the hands of the Preſs-Maſter, or of the Hang-man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:47781:103"/>
There is yet a further ſort of Mungrel-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, or Merchants-Errant, as Common Pedlars, Fidlers, Coblers, Juglers, Fruit-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, Tinkers, Rag-men, Rat-catchers, Rope-Dancers, and the like, which wandring up and down the World, pretend to live by their Labour and their Wits, being a ſort of Pilfring Rogues, fit only to receive their Wages at the Stocks or Whipping-Poſt. As for our <hi>Scotch</hi> Merchants, or Travelling Pedlars, they are not unwelcome to the Places they frequent: for tho they be <hi>Scots,</hi> that is, ſuch as will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looſe any thing which may be got; yet to ſuch who know how to deal with them, they afford good Penny-worths enough, and are inoffenſive in their way of Living; ſo that they are rather to be countenanc'd than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; and if they under-ſell the Shops, 'tis the Drapers fault: For certainly, Men will rather buy what they want when brought home to their Doors, than go abroad to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the ſame at a dearer rate: Perhaps the Shops cannot afford it ſo cheap, being oblig'd to maintain a Family, and to pay Rent, with other Duties: But this is nothing to the Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who will ſtill lay out his Money where he meets with beſt Cheap; which is no other than what the Shop-keepers themſelves do dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice.</p>
               <p>Whether it be better for a Houſe-keeper to have his Work manag'd by Day-Labourers, or by Domeſticks, is a Point likewiſe of ſome Conſideration in the Oeconomy of a Family.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47781:104"/>
Domeſticks probably may be a greater Charge, becauſe we are oblig'd to pay and provide for them, even then when they do us no Service, as in caſe of Sickneſs, or of unſeaſonable Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of wanting a full Employment: In all which caſes, Day-Labourers ly more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie upon us, as being paid no longer than they work; but for all this, 'tis better to have Work wanting for our Servants, than Servants for our Work; and beſides, as Day-Labourers are ever and anon failing us in times of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Occaſion, ſo have they greater opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of cheating their Maſters, by having Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their own where to beſtow whatſoever they can cleverly make away with, and 'tis with ſuch Retainers to Houſes, likewiſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Day-Labourers, Chair-Women, Nurſes and the like, that the Domeſtick Servants themſelves ever hold a more than ordinary Correſpondence in the Art and Methods of Filtching.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of the POOR.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Poor, if they be not a conſiderable, yet are they a Numerous Party in a Commonwealth, and in this ſenſe therefore, worthy of our conſideration. But before I
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47781:104"/>
treat of them with regard to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, I ſhall take a little larger Compaſs, and make ſome Remarks upon them as they ſtood at the beginning, or in the Firſt Ages of the World.</p>
               <p>In the Firſt Ages then, as I have hinted in the precedent Chapter, it was a uſual thing for the poorer ſort of People (who abounded with Children, as living generally a temperate and frugal life) to pawn themſelves and Children to Uſurers upon the Loan of Money, or other Neceſſaries for their Support and Livelihood. The Oppreſſions of theſe Uſurers many times drew ſuch poor People to commit Diſorders, which made <hi>Plato</hi> of old to obſerve, That there were Two Extreams equally deſtructive to a Commonwealth, <hi>viz.</hi> Riches and Poverty: For where Men are very Rich and Great, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially under a Commonwealth, they are apt to fall preſently into Factions: This was the Caſe of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Triumvirates of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſtus;</hi> and ſoon after, of <hi>Auguſtus, M. Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus:</hi> And of later times we find the like in <hi>Florence,</hi> when it was a Commonwealth, till at length all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Power of the <hi>Medici,</hi> who by the help of <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi> who was of that Family, got the Sovereignty over all the reſt. And on the other hand, where a Republick is over-ſtockt with Poor, ſuch Poor being nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous are always ready to be ſeditious, and have ſometimes made the Government to ſhake, when they have reflected a while upon
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47781:105"/>
the unequal Diſtributions of Fortune, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wretched Eſtate they live in, compar'd with that of other Men.</p>
               <p>Upon this Conſideration 'twas, that the moſt celebrated Lawgivers of <hi>Greece</hi> aſſerted an equal Diſtribution of Goods, or at leaſt of Lands, to be the beſt Expedient for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a Commonwealth in Peace and Tranquility, and amongſt the Modern, Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> likewiſe was of this Opinion in his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> being the Model he form'd of a Commonwealth. And yet notwithſtanding ſuch Projects of Wiſe Men, we do not find that they ever brought them to any great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity: For when the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Phocians</hi> planted a Colony, and ſent their Embaſſadors to <hi>Plato,</hi> entreating him to preſcribe them ſome good Laws for the Eſtabliſhment of their New Commonwealth, he miſcarried in his Deſign: For they of the Colony, refuſed to ſubmit to ſuch a levelling or equal Partition of Goods as was contriv'd by his direction. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> is ſaid to have effected this in the alotment he made of Lands, tho with ſome peril of his Life. <hi>Solon</hi> likewiſe was of the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but could never bring his Project about: For when <hi>Agis</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> was attempting to make an equal Diſtribution of Lands, he was ſeiz'd by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and put to Death in Priſon.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but admire a little at the Miſtakes of ſo many wiſe Men: For upon ſuch a levelling of Poſſeſſions theſe fatal incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47781:105"/>
muſt of neceſſity follow, as 1ſt, That no man will think of being induſtrious, when the fruits of his Labour muſt go to maintain the idle and profuſe; nor can a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſubſiſt without Juſtice; nor is there any place for Juſtice, where all Bargains are diſannull'd and baniſhed; nor any Faith and Credit to be given to the moſt ſolemn Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether of Promiſes or Contracts. <hi>2dly,</hi> ſuch a levelling of Lands will make a horrid confuſion and diſtraction in matters of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: For 'tis reported of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the great Oracle of his Age, and Patron of level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that in his own life-time he ſaw above Twenty Heirs to one Eſtate, and likewiſe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Eſtates or Inheritances to fall to one from the want of Heirs in the other Branches of the Family: So that do whatever he could, an inequality of Fortune was the unavoidable conſequence of a Civil Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>However, it muſt be granted too, that in the firſt Planting of a Colony, ſuch <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws may be allowed of, by which all Men may have an equal ſhare in the Dividend; yet ſo as ſtill to allow a Prerogative to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture, and the liberty of after-Contracts, without which a City or Commonwealth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt, and which will inevitably reduce Men under an equality of Fortune: Tho 'twould be ſtill much better, and more juſt, upon the ſettling of a Colony, to proceed not by an Arithmetical Proportion, that is, by an equal diviſion of Lands amongſt the <hi>Coloni;</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:47781:106"/>
but by a Geometrical Proportion, which with regard to Perſons Merits and Circumſtances, allows ſome to have a greater ſhare than others, and this is called <hi>Diſtributive Juſtice:</hi> For to deprive the poorer ſort from having a ſhare in the Dividend, is the way to throw down a New-form'd Government before it is upon the Hinges; as it happened anciently at <hi>Thurium,</hi> where when the Great Ones had monopoliz'd to themſelves all the Lands belonging to that Territory, leaving the poor Debtors under the Burthen and Exaction of their Creditors; ſuch oppreſſed Debtors conſpir'd and expell'd their Lordſhips from their Lands and City: Whereas the prudent <hi>Romans</hi> having ſuch Tumultuous Innovations always before their Eyes, were forc'd oftentimes to ſhew great Indulgence towards the Common People, eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Debtors from the Rigour and Exaction of their Creditors, by a defalcation ſometimes of a fourth, and ſometimes of a Third Part of their Original or Principal Debts.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Trajan,</hi> (at which time the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was at its fulleſt Growth) a poor Man was defin'd by the Laws, to be ſuch an one whoſe Total Subſtance was under the value of Fifty <hi>Aurei,</hi> or Nobles: From whence we gather, that there was a kind of diſtinction with them betwixt <hi>Pauperes</hi> and <hi>Mendecos:</hi> Thoſe of the former Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the Poor, were of a large Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, as containing within their number, ſuch as were low and decay'd in Fortune, as
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47781:106"/>
well as thoſe who ſought their Livelihood by begging in the High-Ways, and creeping from Door to Door: The latter ſort were purely Beggars, and were to be lookt upon therefore as in the loweſt Rank of Humane Fortune: With Analogy to this it is, that the ſtate of a Freeman with us is accounted to be one whoſe Patrimony amounts to Forty Shillings of yearly Rent, and for thoſe who have leſs, they are to be regiſtred amongſt the Poor, and to be exempted from Tribute and Duty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in reality Poor, tho not all alike.</p>
               <p>Another Queſtion likewiſe there is, which I ſhall briefly touch upon, as having ſome affinity with the Subject upon which I am now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, and it is this, <hi>viz. Whether one who is born nobly (or in the Ancient Stile, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and Genteel Family) does forfeit the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of his Birth and Anceſtors, and become ignoble by being poor?</hi> They who hold the Affirmative, build upon this Foundation, to wit, That in Ancient Times the Emperors and (in imitation of them) other Princes were wont to reward the Services of their Vaſſals or Subjects, by beſtowing Lands upon them, and upon their Heirs and Succeſſors for ever, as a peculiar Mark of their good Eſteem and Grace. Theſe Lands ſo diſtributed were called <hi>Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> or Fee-Farms, as being under ſome ſmall Obligation of Chief-Rent or Duty to the Prince of whoſe Bounty they were held, and who in all Ages and Countrys was ever eſteem'd to be the Fountain of Honour: Now if ſuch
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47781:107"/>
Priviledges of Bloud be annext to the Feudal Poſſeſſion, as Teſtimonials of the Princes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the Fee once loſt or ſold, the Vaſſal has nothing to ſhew in evidence for his Honour which he deriv'd by his Anceſtors from the Bounty of the Prince or Emperour. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account it is, that the Titles of Counts and Barons are annext ſo frequently in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and elſewhere, to certain Caſtles and Mannors: So that whoſoever does purchaſe ſuch a Caſtle, does <hi>ipſo facto</hi> become a Count or Baron. Something like to thoſe Feudal Rewards we read amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> who farm out or lett to their Officers and Soldiers of Horſe the Lands of Countrys conquer'd, diſtributing ſuch Lands into Portions, much reſembling our Farms, all which are held of the Grand Seignior at Pleaſure, or for Life; which <hi>Timariots</hi> are oblig'd hereby to attend upon that Emperor in his Wars.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, 'Tis much more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That the Feudal Poſſeſſions or Lands heretofore beſtow'd by the Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors upon their Soldiers and Attendants, were not conferr'd upon them as Marks of Dignity and Honour, but by way of Stipend, thereby binding them to follow ſuch Princes in their Expeditions, as it is at this day practis'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> I ſay, in reference to their <hi>Timariot</hi> Horſe<hi>:</hi> From whence it follows, That as Men were not enobled by ſuch Fee-Farms, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they degraded from the Range in which they were born by the want of them:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47781:107"/>
It being utterly repugnant to Reaſon, and contrary to the Opinion of all wiſe and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, That a Perſon ſhould be more or leſs honourable and praiſe-worthy, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Acres or Baggs, which are the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings of blind and un-diſcerning Fortune, and which fall indifferently upon the Good and Bad, and many times are not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the beſt Men to acquire or preſerve; Nay rather, ſuch Bleſſings are frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd by them: But in caſe a Gentleman be reduc'd to Poverty by his own Prodigal Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or by his infamous and idle life, there is no reaſon he ſhould have a place amongſt thoſe of his own Birth and Quality; ſince hereby his Blood and Honour may as well be ſtain'd, as by his making profeſſion of any ſervile Handicraft: For all Mechanick Arts have been ever accounted to be ſervile and baſe, foraſmuch as the Profeſſors of them, like Horſes and Beaſts of Drudgery, acquire their Livelihood by the Sweat and Labour of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>No leſs baſe or ignoble are they accounted in the Civil Law, who follow any naſty or ſordid Trade, as Butchers, Tanners, Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Hatters, Curriers, Cordwainers, Coblers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And above all, They have been ever lookt upon as vile to the utmoſt degree, who gain their Livelyhood by irreputable and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Profeſſions; ſuch as Hangmen, Pimps, Travellers with Raree-Shews, Tumblers, Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Rope-Dancers, Common Fidlers, Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47781:108"/>
Alehouſe-keepers, and the like; ſo that if a Gentleman once makes a practice of theſe Arts, tho he acquire never ſo great Riches by them, he is utterly degraded from his Poſt of Honour.</p>
               <p>And yet in this degenerate Age, if a Man can but get Wealth, tho in never ſo vile a way, he is without more ado, eſteem'd a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, eſpecially amongſt the poorer ſort. A petty Shop-keeper, or Retailer ſhall cringe, ſneak, flatter humbly, proteſt, ſwear and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear, perhaps, to get a half-penny, and when by the ſtudied and repeated Methods of a vile Condeſcention, with other Shifts and Artifices peculiar to Tradeſmen, he ſhall get an Eſtate, he is reckoned amongſt the Topping-Men, and may arrive poſſibly to the Dignity of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. So likewiſe may we obſerve every where a great number of thoſe whom they call ſhrew'd or Notable Men, that is, ſuch as have a good long Reach in bargaining, truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in managing other Mens Eſtates and Buſineſs, who at length come to be celebrated Uſurers and Purchaſers of Fair Eſtates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Theſe, I ſay, are accounted Capital Gentlemen, and ought doubtleſs, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to Civil Offices: So that if a Man can by a Trick of Legerdemain, Juggle an Eſtate out of the hands of an eaſie Gentleman, he deſerves to be taken notice of under Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of great Reſpect, it being uſual with the Fox (as 'tis reported) by his ſtinking Tricks to poyſon out the Badger from his Hold,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47781:108"/>
which with much labour he had made, and then Earth himſelf in the others Habitation. I have heard of a Practitioner in the Law, who tho he were not very eminent in the knowledge of it, became exceeding rich by puzzling and entangling the Titles of his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and then buying their Eſtates: And ſuch truly is the Method of ſubtle, Time-ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knaves; whilſt many an honeſt, poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman lies under fatal Neceſſities, either from the Extravagances, Number and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, or Proviſions for his Children, or by the Incumbrances upon his Eſtate, or by the heavy expence of a tedious, vexatious and diſaſtrous Suit at Law, or perhaps he ſuffers purely for a good Conſcience in his conſtant adherence to the Rights of his lawful but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince, as we have ſeen too many Examples of this Nature within our own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>Let us come now to the Poor, who by the Laws of our Land are declared Poor, and for whom they have made ſo good Proviſion, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and particularly that Act <hi>for the Relief of the Poor by a Pariſh Rate or Aſſeſſment,</hi> was a very charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deſign, preventing the indigent and needy from wandring about the World, expos'd to Miſery and Famine; the many other proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Acts likewiſe, as of binding poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Apprentices, of ſetting up Work-houſes, or Houſes of Correction, of puniſhing Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, and the like, were ſupplementally
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47781:109"/>
made to promote the General Deſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Neceſſities of Human Nature: But ſo it is, that notwithſtanding all theſe proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Neceſſities of the Poor are as great as ever, and the Pariſhes themſelves, to which ſuch Poor belong, are at a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Charge for want of a true Care and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Management of a Work of this Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. When any poor Perſons, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Poor, ſhall think of ſeeking Relief from a Pariſh, away they Poſt him to the next Juſtice of the Peace, who eaſily mov'd with their Importunities and Complaints, or the interceſſion poſſibly of Friends, too eaſily and frequently grants his Order to the Overſeers of the Pariſh, for the Relief of ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended poor Perſon, without enquiring into Circumſtances. 'Twere much more equitable, if the Juſtice, at ſuch time as the Overſeers bring their Books to them to be Signed, would take their meaſures from the Pariſhioners or Officers themſelves, who certainly muſt be beſt acquainted with the Neceſſities and Courſe of Life of ſuch as pretend to be in Want, and by this Means, many idle Bodies who have waſted their Fortunes, and are ſtill fit for labour, would be made to work, towards the ſupport of themſelves and Families.</p>
               <p>I hold it likewiſe very expedient, that in Corporations and Market Towns, No Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Victualers, Bakers, <hi>cum aliis ejuſdem furfuris,</hi> be ſuffered to execute this Charge: It being too well known, that ſuch Chapmen
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47781:109"/>
make their own Markets and Advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in obliging the Poor to take their Dues for the purpoſe in Bread or Ale, at their pinching Meaſures; whereas, did they diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their Alms in Money, ſuch poor Men or Women could manage, and lay it out with more Frugality and Profit for ſuch things as they ſhould moſt ſtand in need of; ſo that 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 8 <hi>d.</hi> will procure a Peck of Mault ſometimes, and be a Proviſion many days, which when taken out in Ale will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd eaſily at a ſitting. So likewiſe may we obſerve of Mercers and ſuch petty Merchants, that they will put of their worſt Commodities, whether Linnen, Woollen, or other little Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and herewith furniſh the Poor out of the Pariſh Stock, and at ſuch Rates as they think fit: In which caſe the Poor People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive double Dammage, not only in being forced many times to be ſur-charg'd with that, which perhaps they have no great need of; but being ignorant likewiſe of the Quality and Value of ſuch ſtale, half-rotten Ware, they dare not make their Terms with Men who have the Power of their Purſe, but muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the Conſcience and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of a Shop-keeper's Word, which, upon my word too, will many times ply and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it ſelf, not to the Neceſſity of the Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but to the Intereſt of the Seller. The Perſons who are the greateſt Objects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are young Orphans, or the ſuper-nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Children of Poor People or Labourers
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47781:110"/>
as likewiſe expos'd Children, ſick and maimd People, and ſuch as are broken with Age, or ſuch as are reduc'd to Want by the Accidents of Fortune, and perhaps, are aſham'd to expoſe their Miſery, as having liv'd ſometimes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in ſome Credit and Faſhion.</p>
               <p>There are another ſort of Poor likewiſe, which ought truly to be provided for: I mean our luſty, ſturdy, vagrant Beggars of both Sexes: Theſe rambling from Houſe to Houſe are conſtant Retainers to all louſie Inns and Ale-houſes, and are the beſt Informers that Highway-men and Burglares can rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many times pick a Pocket, break a Houſe, ſteal a Horſe, and cut a Throat with as much dexterity as the beſt Profeſſors of theſe Arts. They colour their Rogueries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſguiſe of Tinkers, Crale-Carriers, Ragmen, Inkle or Starch-Sellers, Net-weavers, Travellers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For whom our Laws, 'tis true, have made ſome ſmall Proviſion, but for want of a juſt diſtribution, ſuch pilfring Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds are found to ſwarm every where. It would be much better, if an old Law of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour were reviv'd; by which, <hi>Every ſuch Vagabond as was able to work, became Prize to the next Freeman which met him, and was enroll'd amongſt his Servants or Slaves to Till his Ground during life,</hi> to the end he might not cheat others by his Impoſtures and pretended Beggary. Such a Law as this would be of more advantage to this Nation than any poſſibly now extant,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47781:110"/>
there being no place left for Remiſneſs, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Partiality; for if one ſhould ſuffer ſuch an Errant-Merchant to go free, another would not fail to apprehend him, and where a Man's own Private Intereſt is a Law, it can never happen that ſuch a Law ſhould want its due Execution.</p>
               <p>Under this Head likewiſe we may reduce thoſe whom we commonly call <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or Fortune-Tellers. They are called <hi>Egyptians,</hi> I ſuppoſe from their dark, tawny Complexion, or from their pretended knowledge of the Heavens, and their Deſtinies. In Foreign Parts they are called <hi>Zingars,</hi> which Name ſounds as tho it were of a <hi>Tartar</hi> Extraction. Theſe People, like the <hi>Tartars,</hi> always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing a wandring Life: Tho by the Vulgar they are called Gypſies, <hi>a Gypſo,</hi> from that ſooty Waſh or Paint with which they ſtain their Hands and Faces. Theſe impudent Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds have for a long time rambled over all parts of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and as for thoſe of this Tribe in <hi>England,</hi> they are generally <hi>Broom-makers, Sweep-Chimneys</hi> and the like, and chiefly ſuch as inhabite the Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> who in the Summer-time, for want of Employment, wander about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, having their King over them, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is ſome Broken-Merchant, or well-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Pick-Pocket: But this kind of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min or Inſects does not ſwarm ſo much now-a-dahs, as in former Ages.</p>
               <p>To return therefore to ſuch as are truly Poor, 'Tis certainly a very good work, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47781:111"/>
very acceptable to Almighty God, to relieve their Neceſſities; but 'tis without Diſpute, a better Work to prevent Men from falling into Poverty; For Poverty in it ſelf is a kind of Curſe, and is attended with Miſery: He who repairs a broken Houſe deſerves doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a good Reward, but he deſerves better from the hands of the Lord thereof, who frames ſuch a Building as ſhall never fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to decay. The <hi>Dutch</hi> in this particular are well worthy our Imitation, for by building Publick Work-houſes, whether of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or for the Education and Employment of Children, they make the corrupt and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious parts of the Body Politick, as I may call them, to contribute to their own ſupport, as well as to that of the Government. Little Children which are either poor or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd are committed to Publick Work-houſes, as to Cloiſters or Colledges, and their tender Fingers are taught to work before they can well uſe their Tongues, and being thus inur'd from their Infancy their Hands are much more ready and nimble, whilſt Labour and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry grows up and augments with their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Even the Blind, the Lame, and the like, have Works to be employ'd about: For a blind Man may uſe his Arms in turning of Wheels or Grinding; and he that is lame in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47781:111"/>
Feet: And let not ſuch impotent People lie bawling in the Open Streets, as they do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the Capital City of this Kingdom; many of which Beggars get more Money, and fare better than others by their honeſt Labour and Induſtry.</p>
               <p>As for leſſer Criminals, as Pick-Pockets, Petty-Larceny, Pimps, Common-Whores, Sheep-Stealers, Coney-Catchers, Hedge-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other the like Offenders, whoſe Crimes deſerve not Death, 'twere very good they were condemn'd to <hi>Bridewel</hi> for a Year or two, or more, as the Nature and Circumſtances of their Crimes do require: For by this means they would be made profitable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, whereas Whipping or Frizzing them a little in the Fiſt, is a Puniſhment of no great Pain, and of a ſhort continuance; and ſuch cauteriz'd or Caſe-hardned Rogues as ſoon as out of Jayl are but the more confirm'd in their former Practices. Some few indeed are ſecur'd to Tranſportation: 'Tis pity but there were more of them made to travel the ſame Road; tho the beſt wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, I ſay, would be to keep them to work in Houſes of Correction, ſince we have not Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, as in other Countrys, wherein to beſtow ſuch uſeleſs Lumber.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but think our Laws a little too merciful likewiſe, in puniſhing Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on the High-way and Murderers: For what by the Interceſſion which is made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for the pardoning ſuch Offenders,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47781:112"/>
(which indeed is no defect of the Law) and what by the Contempt which a more obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Felon has of hanging, ſo it is; that ſuch kind of Villains are always numerous. Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Wheel has been found in other Countries to be the beſt Expedient to diminiſh the number of Malefactors. 'Tis true, this ſort of Puniſhment carries the face of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in reſpect of him who ſuffers, where a Man's Bones are broken to pieces, and his Nerves and Sinews beaten to a Pulp, which muſt needs be very dolorous; and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo for twenty four hours or more perhaps, muſt needs be very grievous to him who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and fearful to the Spectators. But after all, it muſt be granted too, that this ſort of Puniſhment is a kind of Mercy to others of Mankind, when by ſeeing ſuch tortur'd Wretches they are reclaim'd from their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courſes by theſe Examples of Horrour; whereas otherwiſe they would be in the like danger of coming to a Fatal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nd. Hence it is, that ſince <hi>Breaking on the Wheel</hi> has been practis'd in <hi>France,</hi> there has not been the Tenth Part of the Robberies committed, as before; whereas under the gentler Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hanging, few are mov'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Malefactor, who ends his life in a compendious way, and probably in leſs pain than many who die a Natural Death. The End of Puniſhment is not Expiation; it may be ſatisfactory to the Law, there may be Confeſſion likewiſe, and poſſibly Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47781:112"/>
but 'tis the Mercy only of God through the Merits of Chriſt Jeſus, which muſt aſſiſt the Guilty: The end therefore of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is for prevention of the like Offences and Amendment, which in Capital Caſes can never have place in the Offendor; it muſt be therefore <hi>in terrorem,</hi> in regard of others, <hi>ne &amp; ipſi veniant in eundem locum tormentorum;</hi> that by their wicked actions <hi>they may not come into the ſame place of Torment;</hi> which End, if it cannot be obtain'd by one Method of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, Religion and Juſtice do adviſe the Magiſtrate (who is to have regard to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men) to have recourſe to one which is more ſevere, that others may be brought off from the like Precipice and Deſtruction, as we ſee they are moſt effectually by ſuch rigorous Examples of Juſtice, or (to ſpeak more truly) rather of Mercy.</p>
               <p>The Charities of <hi>Rome</hi> make a Noiſe in the World, and if they be not perform'd <hi>with ſound of Trumpet,</hi> certain it is, that they are Pompous and full of Oſtentation. Many of their Methods are moſt worthy our Imitation, tho in general it muſt be ſaid too, that at firſt ſight nothing leſs appears than Charity; ſuch is the number of Naſty Beggars, of maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſick People, and of Idle Vagabonds. Where they lodge a Nights God only knows, and perhaps the Pope, but certain it is, that the Streets and Piazza's are full of them all the day; whether it be that the Report of the <hi>Roman</hi> Charities does draw Beggars from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47781:113"/>
Quarter, or that men truſting to ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief do neglect an honeſt and laborious courſe of Life; or that the Genius of the <hi>Italians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining them to Lazineſs, whilſt the Gabels and Taxes they live under do reduce them to an humble State of Life; or that the Charities themſelves be diſtributed in ſuch a frugal and ſtinted manner, as ſhall only ſerve to keep Men Needy, and in a condition of craving Alms; whether, I ſay, upon any, or perhaps upon all theſe Conſiderations, it ſo happens, this is certain, that there are vaſt numbers of ſuch half-ſtarv'd Wretches ready every where to periſh. The like alſo may be obſerv'd all along the Country betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> which naturally is one of the moſt fertile Spots in the whole World, and yet the pooreſt and moſt beggarly in its Inhabitants. And as for <hi>Rome,</hi> I believe his Holineſs would be Author of as great a Charity as any that City can pretend to, if he would convert ſome Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into Houſes of Correction, and there em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome of the many idle Merchants that place is infeſted with, in making ſome profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Manufacture, which, as 'twould be of great advantage to the Apoſtolick <hi>Comera,</hi> or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and bring that City into ſome form of Trade, ſo would it be found moſt acceptable to God, to whom nothing is more odious than Idleneſs, the Nurſe of all Vices, and nothing can be more acceptable to him, than to ſee men taught to live in an honeſt, laborious courſe of life, and ſo to be delivered from that Train of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47781:113"/>
Vices and Calamities of Poverty which attend always Men of baſe Condition and Fortune, once abandon'd to Eaſe; and conſequently nothing could be more beneficial to Men than to be tranſlated from ſuch Miſeries into a State of Credit and Plenty.</p>
               <p>But leaving theſe Foreign Objects, and to come to the Poor of our Country Pariſhes, upon whoſe Account I now write, 'twere beſt worthy the Conſideration of the Juſtices and Pariſh-Officers, to eaſe the Husbandman in Years of great Plenty; for then it is that half the Money will buy the Poor as much Bread as they ſpent in other Years; and then likewiſe 'tis that the Husbandman, perhaps, cannot make half ſo much of his Grain as in Years of greater Scarcity, being forc'd to give greateſt Wages in Times of greateſt Plenty, as hath been obſerv'd before. Hence likewiſe it is, that as in Years of Plenty, ſo in Countries al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Plenty, there are moſt Beggars; for few will trouble themſelves to eat their Bread in the Sweat of their Brows, which they may feed on with Eaſe and for Nothing. In theſe Years and Places therefore of Plenty 'tis that more than ordinary Care ſhould be taken to ſet the Wanderer to work, and to lay up in ſtore for the Impotent and Needy, and to reſtrain and puniſh all Merchants-errant, who under ſhew of carrying Crales or Packs at their Backs lie pilfering and ſharking every where, to the great Annoyance of all honeſt Houſekeepers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:47781:114"/>
Let this Point then be the Centre of all that can be ſaid of the Poor, or of Works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>viz.</hi> Publick Colleges or Work-Houſes; and here let the ſcatter'd Currents of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties meet, were there but Publick Spirits either to contribute to, or with a little Pains and Honeſty to overſee ſuch a Pious Deſign, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany would ſoon be impracticable, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Poor diminiſhed, and ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main would be well provided for. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Taxations likewiſe would be eas'd, the Manufactures of the Nation would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and Foreign Importations would be leſſened. The Profits ariſing from the Labour of ſturdy Vagabonds, of lazy, faithleſs Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and of leſſer Criminals, would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Orphans, and educate them in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Induſtry; and if the Felons and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rogues, with which the Goals are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd, were oblig'd to Labour, during their Confinement, it would be a great Eaſe to the County, and to ſuch Felons themſelves too, by preſerving them from being inſtructed in farther Rogueries, and from being idle, and talking only with their Fellow-Priſoners of former Pranks: So that once in a Goal, and a Rogue ever after.</p>
               <p>Out of this Bank or Stock of the Work-Houſe might Money be lent <hi>gratis,</hi> or without Uſury, to poor Tradeſmen or Husbandmen, to ſet them up with, or to relieve the Loſſes and Misfortuens of others, provided they ſhould give good Security for the Capital; or if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47781:114"/>
longer than half a Year, to pay Intereſt for the ſame. Out of this Fund likewiſe might ſome Proviſions be made for binding of Apprentices, for marrying poor Girls, and for the Repair of Hedges, High-ways; and the like. If there were Colleges and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals likewiſe for the Reception and Breeding up of expos'd Infants, as is practis'd in <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere, there to be train'd up to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and to Vertue, it would prevent many a Murder of ſuch ſhiftleſs Innocents; nor ſhould we ſee ſuch a Number of little Brats carried at the Backs of Beggar-Women from Door to Door, which, when a little grown up, run begging about the World, till coming to Years of Ripeneſs, or rather of Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they ingender the like beggarly Spawn or Fry, and ſo on to the end of the World. Such a Proviſion for Baſtards, as I am now ſpeaking of, would not be an Encouragement for People to encreaſe their Number, ſince their Parents ſhould be oblig'd to labour in ſuch Publick Houſes till the Children were able to get their own Livings. This would be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Puniſhment than that of binding one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent only in a Pecuniary Caution to Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Pariſh, which thing as yet is rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; whereas Four or Five Years Labour in Publick Houſes would be a great Eaſe and Security to the Pariſh; and the Diſgrace, and Laborious Imployments of ſuch Places would deter Men and Women more from their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courſes than any Amercement whatſoever.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47781:115"/>
And as for our Pariſh-Children, as we call them, ſuch as Orphans, Baſtards, and the like, they are commonly entruſted by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers of the Poor to ſome idle Houſewife, who does juſt keep them alive, and teach them perhaps a little to read, and to run a leaſing and loitering in the Streets, and there learn Roguery, till the Eigth or Ninth Year of their Age; whereas, were they committed to ſuch Publick Colleges or Houſes, before ſpoken of, and being under the Care of honeſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd, and induſtrious Overſeers, they would ſoon be taught to earn their Bread, and be out of all Danger of being corrupted by Idleneſs and Ill Example.</p>
               <p>I know a Gentleman who once deſign'd to bequeath his Eſtate to a Corporation in truſt, and to be employ'd for the Erection of a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Work-houſe, and afterwards for laying in a Fund or Stock for employing Whores and Rogues, the Profits whereof (ſome Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being had to the Governours and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of ſuch a Work) to be employ'd for the Uſes above-mentioned, the Scheme whereof I ſhall not trouble my Reader. But ſo it was, that he was ſoon after inclin'd to revoke his Charitable Deſign, when he conſider'd the Buſineſs, or rather the ſacrilegious Diſpoſition of ſome Bodies or Societies: There being too many deplorable Examples before our Eyes of thoſe who within their own Doors are moſt ſordid and Niggard-like, but do not ſcruple to ſpend ſuch Charitable Stocks, or the Bread
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47781:115"/>
of poor Orphans, I may ſay truly the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, in making riotous Feaſts and Entertainments, and in impertinent and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous drinking of Healths, or perhaps in private Purloinings. And that this is not a paſſionate Invective, but a ſerious, tho' deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorable Truth, would be but too legible, were there an impartial Inſpection made into ſome Chamber-Accounts: For the Redreſs whereof we do not find any due Care taken. Charities therefore of this kind, ought, upon mature Conſideration, to be entruſted with ſuch; for tho' there be ſome honeſt Men to Day who rule the Roaſt, to Morrow there may be thoſe of another Kidney: So that upon all Publick Occaſions and Expence, Charitable Uſes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally muſt bear the Burthen.</p>
               <p>The Mounts or Banks of Piety, ſuch as they have in <hi>Rome,</hi> and elſewhere, are excellent Proviſions: For out of theſe and ſuch-like Funds, young expos'd Children are bred up and provided for; Fortunes are given to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of them in the World, Moneys lent without Intereſt, and many other Publick Works carried on: But, as I ſaid before, a competent Number of <hi>Bridewells,</hi> or Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes, would be of as great or greater Uſe, which yet they want. They ſend them indeed to the Galleys, but that is not a Method ſo advantageous.</p>
               <p>And as for our ſelves here in <hi>England,</hi> the beſt Truſtees for ſuch Publick and Charitable Deſigns would be the Juſtices of Peace in a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47781:116"/>
County, provided there were Choice of ſuch as are of Integrity and of a Publick Spirit: For theſe generally being Gentlemen of ſome Fortune, would not ſo eaſily be tempted by ſordid Ends; nor could they conveniently do it were they ſo diſpos'd, their Concerns being independent on one another, and all things being expos'd to the View of the World in an Open Court: Were they therefore enabled by Act of Parliament to purchaſe Ground and build Work-houſes in Corporations and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Towns, a Reſervation being made in City-Charters for ſuch a Liberty; and if there were Viſitors or Judges appointed by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every Three Years, to inſpect the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of ſuch Juſtices, and to ſtrengthen ſuch Pious Deſigns with all due Proviſions, as from time to time ſhould become expedient, I doubt not but it would be the beſt Work that ever was undertaken, whether we conſider the Glory of God, the Good and Wealth of the Nation in general, the Prevention of infinite Diſorders, and the Relief of Thouſands, who otherwiſe would periſh, Soul and Body. And that upon a due Execution of ſuch wholſome Proviſions, 'tis no way to be doubted but ſuch vaſt Numbers of well-inclin'd Perſons would daily be invited to beſtow bountifully in their Life-time, and at their Deaths bequeath ample Legacies, to promote Works of ſo great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Piety.</p>
               <p>But before I ſhall proceed farther in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I ſhall, with my Reader's Leave, make
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47781:116"/>
ſome Remarks which I have ever look'd upon to have a conſiderable Influence in Increaſing the Number of our Poor, which, if not pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently remedied, will make way for farther Diſtempers, and the Danger ſtill is greater; foraſmuch as the Things I am now to ſpeak of are not really Vices in themſelves, but on the contrary are eſteem'd generally as very conſiderable, and ſuch by which Men ſeem to purchaſe a kind of Eſteem and Honour amongſt the Generality of Men: Of which</p>
               <p>The Firſt is our Extravagance and Luxury in Apparel. All Ages and Nations of the World have ever had Regard to this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, eſteeming a fantaſtick and variable Dreſs to be the greateſt Index of Levity in the Mind, and a very ſuperfluous Expence. The <hi>Jews</hi> of old conſtantly kept to one kind of Habit, as did alſo the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> The like alſo we may obſerve at this Day, and from Time Immemorial amongſt all the vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of the Eaſt, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, as alſo throughout all <hi>Africa,</hi> and the greateſt Kingdoms of the North; in all which Places every Nation has kept conſtantly to its own Habit, being ſuch as was moſt convenient for their Bodies, and moſt ſuitable to the Air and Climate in which they lived: And even in <hi>Europe,</hi> beſides the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites</hi> who ſtick faſt to their Ancient Faſhions, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are a very great People, are very regular in this Particular; ſo that their Sobriety herein muſt be look'd upon as a great
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47781:117"/>
Help to keep up the Gravity and Grandeur of a Nation which otherwiſe would fall into a lower degree of Poverty than that under which they now lie, ſhould they indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Vanity of new Modes; ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences being utterly inconſiſtent with Men abandon'd generally to Eaſe and Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Nay, that Nation from whom we borrow all our foppiſh and fantaſtick Garbs, obſerve ſome ſort of a <hi>Decorum</hi> in this Matter: For all their Students in the Law, their Advocates and Notaries, wear ſhort Cloaks, with wide Breeches, and ſhort-skirted Doublets, of black Cloth, with little Bands. Their Phyſicians likewiſe, and generally the Burgheſſes of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter note, wear the like modeſt Habit. But with us in <hi>England,</hi> all from Prince <hi>Pretty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to <hi>Tom Thimble</hi> are <hi>Meſſires Alamode:</hi> So that in this Senſe we may be truly ſaid to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>French.</hi> It is a common Saying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Fopling Gallants, That 'tis very ridiculous for a Man or Woman to be known by their Cloaths; and ſo ſay I too, being of the Opinion, That a Perſon is better known by Changeable and Party-colour'd Cloaths than by a plain, modeſt Dreſs; this being the Habit of ſober Perſons, which few are capable to underſtand, but the other is that which all gaze at, being the Livery of Changelings and Fools. The various Fancies and Faſhions which Men and Women ſo highly value, is a thing certainly moſt vain and ridiculous; ſo
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47781:117"/>
that were a Nobleman to furniſh his Gallery with Pictures, I think he could not hit upon a Fancy more to his Diverſion than to have ſome quarter of it furniſh'd with Paintings repreſenting all the Faſhions of both Sexes which have been worn by us within theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, that is to ſay; from the Downfal of Ruffs to the Up-riſing of Commodes; all which are ſo various and unlike, that were a grave, ſober <hi>Turk</hi> to view them, he would conclude that they were the Modes of all Nations of the Earth, both paſt and preſent; and ſo great a Value as we our ſelves had once for them, we muſt now laugh at them as very Antick, and more Comical than all the <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouchio's</hi> and <hi>Harlequi's</hi> in the World, and by conſequence we muſt condemn our ſelves as guilty of extreme Levity and Folly.</p>
               <p>The true Uſe of Raiment is to cover our Nakedneſs, and to defend our Bodies from the Injuries of the Seaſon: Now certain 'tis, that he who has but one or two Suits of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, whole and clean, well fitted to his Body, is as well or better provided than he who has ſix or ſeven in his Wardrobe, where the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Change many times proves injurious to Health, and before he has half worn out one Suit, the reſt muſt be laid aſide and given to a Train of lubbarly Waiting-Men, upon the Aſſurance Mr. Taylor gives us, upon his honeſt Word, that 'tis out of Faſhion; and then my Gallant muſt flutter abroad again, Top-and-top-Gallant, in his new Mode, with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47781:118"/>
a dainty hard Name: By which means many Gentlemen, eſpecially the younger Sons, or thoſe of ſmaller Fortunes, who ſtill are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to appear abroad equipp'd like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, forſooth, are reduc'd to the utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; till, in ſine, Maſter-Taylor, from taking Meaſure of my Spark's Body, comes at laſt perhaps to take the Meaſure of his Eſtate, or it may be provides him with a Tenement for Term of Life, which he cannot eaſily run out of.</p>
               <p>Then for the Richneſs or Gaudery of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, this ought to be taken notice of as much as the Vanity of ſupernumerous Habits. 'Tis pleaſant to obſerve what Difference there is many times in the Air and Deportment of the ſame Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47781:118"/>
and if ſaluted, he returns the Civility by an Offer only to touch the Brim of his ſhining Caſtor, or perhaps with a Nod. Now, if we conſider the Matter rightly, the true Ground upon which ſuch a Grandee expects more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards than formerly, is not from any ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſciouſneſs of his own Merit, but purely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore of his Apparel; ſo that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (if any) is really due to the Sheep which bore the fineſt Wooll out of which his Cloth was made, or to the Inſect or Worm which gave the Silk to make his gloſſy Ribbons; ſo that 'tis not the Man, but the Beaſt, all the while, which is the Object of our Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The greateſt and wiſeſt Princes of the Earth, how vain and pompous ſoever they have been in ſetting out their Grandeur, ever affected a Modeſty in Apparel, eſpecially in their uſual and ordinary Entertainments, leaving their Gold Laces, and glittering Colours to their Pages and Footmen.</p>
               <p>In fine, The words of the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> are moſt worthy our Remembrance, when he tells us <hi>(cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Eccleſ.) A mans Attire, exceſſive Laughter and Gate ſhew what he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another thing which I ſhall take notice of as very deſtructive to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing many of them to Beggary and Miſery, is their ill Education, which in truth, reflects more upon the Parents than upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: For whilſt the Heir ſweeps away the Eſtate, the younger Brothers (upon the death
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47781:119"/>
of their Parents) being never ſetled in a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor inur'd to Labour, become wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſhiftleſs. 'Tis true, ſome there are who are apprentic'd out, and ſome few others there are who follow Divinity, or rather the Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, eſpecially ſince the Tub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preachers have been remov'd: But ſtill there remains a vaſt Number of them who have no other Calling but that of haunting Taverns, Play-houſes, Gaming-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and bawling after a Pack of Dogs, or of ſharking from Houſe to Houſe, which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the modiſh Word, they call viſiting of Friends.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Gentry, 'tis true, do not much affect to place their Children to Trades, or to make any Alliance with the Shop; but then they have other ways to diſpoſe of their ſuperfluous Suckers: For beſides their Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Clergy, which far ſurpaſſes ours, and which are in a manner engroſs'd by the Nobility or Gentry, they have an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Monaſteries likewiſe, wherein they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow or barrel up the Overplus of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; which Monaſteries are ſafe and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Places alſo for their leſs uſeful Members to retreat in, having been diſgrac'd by Fortune, or ſuch as otherways are burthenſome, and diſpos'd to live a contemplative and retir'd Life. But beſides theſe they have other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces too wherein to beſtow their Members, I mean their Garriſons and Armies; and truly, were it not for ſuch Iſſues of War, a Country
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47781:119"/>
ſo luxuriant as <hi>France</hi> is, would ſoon fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fatal Diſtempers by the Redundency of its own peccant Humour: So that the preſent Greatneſs of that Kingdom is not to be aſcrib'd to the Temper and Diſpoſitions of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (who generally are as light, extravagant, and unconſtant as any Nation whatſoever,) but to the Maxims of their two great Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miniſters, and above all to the vaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Genius of the preſent Monarch. And yet after all their Politick Methods of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Leiſure-Gentlemen, there are vaſt Numbers of them ſwarming in all Towns; ſome of which live an eaſie, ſupine Life; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by Tennis, Gaming, Rooking, and Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, which ſome call living by their Wits; and twere very well if they were made alſo to live by their Hands, by ſerving an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip in the Galleys, as many of them do effectually. However, I do not take the great Appearance theſe Men make in their Towns and Cities to be an Argument of their more exceeding Number: For ſhould our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry, like the <hi>French,</hi> quit the Country for the ſofter Life of the Town, I doubt not but that they would make as great a Shew to the full.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, we of this Nation are at preſent falling into the like Methods with <hi>France:</hi> For as long as the War laſts, we are not likely to want Utterance for our Dreggs, nor truly of running into our former Exceſſes by our waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Profuſion of Money; ſo that we are or
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47781:120"/>
may be out of all danger of dying by a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thory. And yet let the Sword take off as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as it pleaſes, there are a great many more who go the back way off the Stage by the Goal, the Pox, and the Gallows. The pilfering, ſtinging Waſps, the buzzing Flies, and the gawdy Butterflies, are all of them a droniſh and lazy kind of Inſects which are ingender'd of Corruption, by the Warmth of the Sun, and fly from Place to Place, corrupting and tainting all they feed upon, but withal they are but ſhort-liv'd; and if there are any of the Brood I am now ſpeaking of, who ſurvive or eſcape a more compendious Deſtiny, they live but a preminary kind of Life amongſt their Friends and Acquaintance, and at the beſt end their Days in an Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> (following the Biaſs of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths) have little Eſteem of Nobility. In this however they are moſt worthy our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in that they make little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Noble and Ignoble, as to their Courſe of Life, thinking all oblig'd to make Profeſſion of ſome Calling, by which they may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Publick and to themſelves too. For ſome Members to lie always idle, whilſt others labour p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47781:120"/>
ſort or other of a Calling, has the means of Living in his own Hands, and knows how to begin a new in the World when Fortune ſhall reduce him to any Extremity.</p>
               <p>And altho' a Gentleman does not make ſome Mechanick Art to be his Profeſſion, there is no Abſurdity for him to make it his Recreation, as well to divert his Spirits ſometimes, and keep him out of Idleneſs, as alſo to get his Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by it in caſe he fall into Misfortune and Poverty: A thing generally practis'd by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes, upon Pretence that they ought to live upon their own Bread which they get by ſuch means. Nor is it one of the leaſt Policies of the Jeſuites to encourage their Miſſionaries hereunto, or at leaſt to initiate ſuch amongſt them who are of a working Genius, making them to underſtand and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ſome Handicrafts, the better poſſibly to diſguiſe their Negotiations or Miſſions in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they are not allow'd of; as alſo to inſinuate the better into all ſorts of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to be able to live of themſelves when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are put to their ſhifts: And by ſuch means chiefly 'tis that ſuch Miſſionaries have made ſo great a Progreſs in the Eaſtern Parts of the World, and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>As every Family conſiſts of ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers under the Government of one Head, as Parent or Maſter; ſo every Family, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Duty in training up his Children in a regular Courſe of Life and Employment, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which is the grand Parent of all Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Subordinate Parents, and of all their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, may and ought to take care of ſuch Members of Families as are in danger of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, and of being troubleſome to he Publick; and this they ought to do, by placing them in ſome Calling or other, as ſhall ſeem beſt to the Magiſtrate. And 'tis pity but ſuch Laws were enacted amongſt us, enabling him to execute a Charge of ſuch Importance, and grounded upon ſo much Reaſon. And in caſe Perſons of looſe Lives, whether Gentle or Ungentle, ſhould be found Refractory and Pernicious, 'twere not the worſt Method to cultivate them, as we do thoſe Trees which are Canker-eaten, from too much luxuriancy of the Soil, by pruning and lopping of their Superfluities, and then tranſplant them into a leaner Earth, and ſo make them capable of bearing Fruit. And truly our Weſtern Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations would very well agree with many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Plants, with which this Kingdom is over-ſtock'd, we having but too many of both Sexes, who by too much fatneſs of the Ground are over-run with the Canker, but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd into another Climate would encreaſe and fructifie.</p>
               <p>The Countries which are poor, but not the Poor of a Country, produce the beſt Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as appears by the <hi>Switz,</hi> and <hi>Highlanders</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and generally in all the Northern
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47781:121"/>
People: For Poor, Vagabond Rogues are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, dull of Apprehenſion, Intractable, and uncapable of Diſcipline, and withal, deſtitute of Courage and Spirit, which is the Life and Soul of a Soldier; when, on the other hand, ſuch as are born under a hungry Climate, in a ſharp and cold Air, like our Breed of Horſes, are beſt for Service: They have ſufficient to keep them from Want, and therefore are not broken in their Strength; and yet are not weakened by Surfeit, and therefore fit for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and in a Capacity of bettering their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by the Fortune of Arms: So that in an Invaſive War this ſort of Men are very uſeful; for there 'tis the Prey only which draws them to Action, whilſt they that be Rich are not only debauch'd with Eaſe, but care not much to hazard what they have upon uncertain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. And yet in a Defenſive War the Rich are beſt: For thoſe of ſcanty Fortunes have nothing to loſe, and therefore they will not much concern themſelves which way Matters go; whereas the Rich, having all at Stake, will puſh hard to defend their Intereſt, which if they cannot do by their own Perſons, they are capable nevertheleſs of procuring others to fight for them, by means of their Money, as is at this Day evident in the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are not very good at Conqueſt, or the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Boundaries, but are very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and obſtinate in Defence of their own; ſo that in the Main or Summ of the Matter, Commonwealths are better at keeping, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47781:122"/>
Monarchies at enlarging their Territories; and certainly that Prince or Commonwealth is in the beſt Poſt and Circumſtance for War which has Subjects of both theſe Capacities; I mean ſome which are inur'd to Hardſhip, and others which are Wealthy; and by this means a Prince has Money wherewith to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelf with Arms and Military Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Men to manage them upon all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies.</p>
               <p>And 'tis as certain too, that that People or Nation is in the beſt Condition of any which live under ſuch a Prince or Government, as does not thirſt after Conqueſt and widening of Empire, but contrives rather to preſerve Subjects in Peace and Plenty: For 'tis the Peoples Purſe which muſt bleed to carry on the Deſigns of an Ambitious Prince, in which if he miſcarry, they who did contribute to the War, are utterly undone; and if he be ſucceſsful, the People are never reimburs'd their Money, but are ſtill miſerable, by falling under one whoſe Appetite of Dominion is enlarg'd by Conqueſt, and by this means alſo has greater Strength to wreſt future Supplies to carry on his windy Pretences, having a drawn Sword in his Hand, and being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Armies inur'd to Blood; ſo that they who firſt ſupported him in his popular Quarrels, and hugg'd themſelves by claiming a Share in the good Fortunes which their own Money procur'd, will be found in the end to be in a vanquiſh'd and very miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47781:122"/>
when they thought moſt of being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Whether the Bird be kill'd by a ſudden and unavoidable Shot, or fall leiſurely and ſmoothly into the Snares or Net of the Fowler, by liſtening to the ſweet Modulation of his ſoft and fallacious Prize, is much the ſame to the poor Creature which becomes a Prey. Nay, rather of the two, 'tis better for Men to fall under the Hands of a Conqueror, who may challenge a juſt Title to their Service, than to ſtep inſenſibly into Slavery by their own Sloth and Over-Credulity.</p>
               <p>When the Inhabitants of <hi>Himera,</hi> a City of <hi>Sicily,</hi> conſulted the Poet <hi>Steſichorus</hi> about chooſing <hi>Phalaris</hi> for their General, he tells them this Fable: <hi>The Horſe and the Stag feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Meadow, they could not well agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; whereupon the former, being diſtruſtful of his own Strength, to wage War with a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſo much Activity and Majeſty, flies to the Husbandman for ſuccour, who told him he would undertake to deliver him from his Fears were he but arm'd and mounted. The Horſe, overjoy'd at the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, ſuffers the armed Man to bridle and ſaddle him, and to get upon him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that by the help of the Man upon his Back, he made the Stag quit the Coaſt, and began to triumph as Victor. But, on the other hand, the Husbandman finding the Horſe he had mounted to be a ſerviceable Beaſt, would not ſuffer him to return and wanton again in the rich Meadows; but inuring him to the Bridle and Saddle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually rid him as often as he pleas'd, laying</hi>

               <p>Men being uneaſie under the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of ſeeking Relief by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſters, has caus'd great Revolutions in Kingdoms, and involv'd Subjects in perpetual Wars and Miſeries, as is obvious from infinite Examples. I ſhall for the preſent content my ſelf with one, and a very Remarkable one, in this our Kingdom. <hi>Richard</hi> II. was a Prince who ſuffer'd himſelf to be too much biaſſed by evil Councils, and thereby gave great Diſtaſt to moſt of his Subjects; amongſt whom <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bullingbrook,</hi> a ſubtile Prince, and near Allied to the Crown, was more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently offended; inſomuch that croſſing the Seas with a ſmall Force, being before-hand aſſur'd of the Affection and Aſſiſtance of the Nobility, Gentry, and Common People, who all flock'd to him upon his Landing, as did alſo the Army which was levied to oppoſe him, he eaſily ſurpriz'd the abandon'd King, pretending at firſt, and ſwearing ſolemnly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacrament, that he came not over to ſeek the Crown, but to ſet the King and his People to rights, and to preſerve his Own.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47781:123"/>
The poor, eaſie, or rather uneaſie King, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf forſaken by all, was forc'd to credit his Couſin's Proteſtations, till reſigning up himſelf into his Hands he became his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and to lengthen out his unfortunate Life a little, was contented to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there reſigning the Crown, was afterwards murdered. No ſooner was <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> IV. ſaluted King, but the People began to repent of what they had done, finding all <hi>Henry</hi>'s Pretences of Reforming Abuſes and Redreſſing of Grievances to be meer Sham: So that great Plots and Conſpiracies were laid to diſmount their Rider; after which enſued a moſt Bloody and Laſting Civil War, which never ended till the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> to whom the Crown of Right belong'd, was ſeated in the Throne. The Calamities enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Richard</hi>'s being depos'd, are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly expreſs'd by Mr. <hi>Daniel</hi> (who was a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of more than ordinary Depth of Thought) when he brings in that unfortunate King by a <hi>Proſopopoeia,</hi> upbraiding <hi>England</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of Juſtices of the Peace with other Inferiour Officers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Office of a Juſtice of the Peace as it is Ancient, ſo is it very Reputable. They who bare this Office being appointed by the King to be <hi>Cenſores Morum,</hi> in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and by reaſon of their great Number and Quality, as likewiſe of there Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they be allow'd to have a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Influence upon the Affairs of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Diſorders of whatſoever kind, as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, Frays, Profanation of the Lords-day, Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Frauds in Dealing, Purloinings, Hedge-breakings, Deſtruction of Game, unlawful Meeting of Conventicles, all unlawful Gaming, Vagabonds, Petty Factions; as alſo greater Offences againſt the Crown, as Treaſon, Murderers, Thefts, Burglaries, with infinite other Enormities, fall under their Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance; but more eſpecially are they bound by Duty to have a ſtrict regard to the Three foregoing Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> Ale-houſes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Servants, and the Poor: So that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſmaller Moment, they have the final Deciſion, and of all Criminal Cauſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47781:125"/>
which ſhall happen within theſe reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Limits, they have the firſt Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by them ſuch Offences are remitted to a further Tryal.</p>
               <p>Now Country Gentlemen are lookt upon to be the fitteſt Inſtruments for Executing this Truſt, and that upon theſe two Accounts: <hi>Firſt,</hi> In regard of their Eſtates: For being (or at leaſt as they ought to be) Gentlemen of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they are not apt to be Corrupted as other Officers whoſe Fortunes and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood depends upon the Profit of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. In the next place, living in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, they are more Competent Judges of Perſons and Offences, and more eaſie to be Recours'd to for Remedies of all Diſorders, then others who are ſtrangers, and at great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſtance. But notwithſtanding the good and laudable Intention of the Government there are to be found daily too too many of undue-Qualifications entruſted with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this important Charge; ſome there are indeed very Beneficial to the Country, and an Ornament to their Office, but whilſt others are defective, the <hi>Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> makes but ſmall advance: But however ſtands the Caſe, 'tis certain, that none ought to be deputed to this Truſt, but ſuch as are duly Qualified as to theſe Particulars: 1ſt, A Competency of Knowledge; 2dly, Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Life; 3dly, Courage and Reſolution, and 4thly, Prudence, or a Command over his own Paſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:47781:125"/>
The firſt Qualification neceſſary in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, is Competency of Underſtanding or Knowledge of the Laws, Statutes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Nation in which he lives. I do not think it Neceſſary he ſhould be as Learned as <hi>Tiberian, Cujac</hi> or Sir <hi>Edward Coke;</hi> that he ſhould be able to penetrate all the difficult Caſes which may ariſe betwixt Man and Man, whether in theſe Publick or private Relations, with all the Niceties which a Scrupulous and ſubtle Brain can ſtart or invent; ſo on the other hand, it might reaſonably be expected that he ſhould be one of ſomething a better Culture than to be able only to Spell his Name in a ſcrawling Character; long Coats may become ſome ſorts of Creatures well enough, but to ſee them in long Robes or the Habiliments of Magiſtracy, tho' it may move the ſerious Spectators ſometimes to merriment and laughter, yet it cannot chooſe but touch him with a ſecret diſlike.</p>
               <p>The next Qualification requiſite in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, is Integrity of Life and Manners: And this indeed is ſomething more Commendable than the former: For Knaves there are, and too many of them who have a ſufficient Stock of Underſtanding or rather of Learning; but to be a good Man, as it clears his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all Imputation and Craft, ſo it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers him from the opprobrious Character of a Fool. A Fool 'tis true, may ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an honeſt Act, as a good Man may a Fault,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47781:126"/>
by Inadvertancy and Miſtake; but he who is truly Honeſt and Conſcientious propoſes well in all his deſigns without Hypocriſie and private reſerve, and ſeldom trips or makes a blunder, the Example of a Magiſtrate is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of much more force then his Orders: For by the one he Excites and Invites, by the other he drives and Compells, which implies ſomething of Reluctancy on his part who is Commanded: And ſince Men naturally are more prone to Vice, they cannot but poſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a full Career, when they are aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Wings of Authority: For who can be ever brought to have a Deteſtation of Drunkenneſs, and of miſpending his Time, when he has the Authentick Examples of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace before his Eyes, not only inviting them to Drinking, and making ſuch Exceſs to be very Genteel and Orthodox, but Patronizing perhaps, the very Houſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the Soul and Centre of their Mirth and Refreſhment, and the beſt Support, poſſibly, of their Intereſt.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but make a Curſory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon what occur'd at the Time I was making theſe Reflections in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood where I live. It is of a Juſtice of the Peace of ſome Figure and Popularity, whom it pleas'd God, in the Time of his Sickneſs, to touch with a deep Senſe of his former Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and of the Miſchief he had done to others by his vicious Example; inſomuch that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſent his Circular Letters to be read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47781:126"/>
on <hi>Sundays</hi> in the Neighbouring Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; in which Confeſſionary Letters he moſt Conſcientiouſly owns his former Riotous Courſe of Living, in Swearing, Drinking, Laſciviouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as likewiſe the Glory he took in drawing others to Intemperance, and ſeeing them wallow in their own Beſtiality. All which he heartily bewails, and ſeriouſly exhorts his Friends and Acquaintance to take Example by him, humbly craving their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Almighty God on his behalf; deſiring furthermore, that in caſe it ſhould pleaſe God to reſtore him to Life, and he ſhould relapſe into his former wicked Courſes, that ſuch his Publick Recantation or Conſeſſion ſhould be urg'd againſt him, to his perpetual Reproach and Infamy. Which Pious Diſpoſition of his, as it ought in Chriſtian Charity to be look'd upon as proceeding from God's extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Mercy to him, in filling him with true Sorrow and Repentance, ſo there is great Hopes likewiſe that (notwithſtanding the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Corruptions of the Age) the Example of ſuch a contrite Penitent may have a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon many of thoſe whom this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's former Converſation had corrupted and poiſoned. Nor ſhould I have been ſo particular in mentioning theſe Paſſages, had not the Gentleman himſelf deſir'd to make his Confeſſion and Sorrow as Publick as poſſible, for the Good and Benefit of others, as well as for the Eaſe of his own Soul, which God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

There is another ſort of Corruption to which Men in Office are often ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> Partiality in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice; which proceeds ſometimes from an irregular Affection, but more frequently from Bribery and Covetouſneſs. This is an Epidemical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper which has reign'd in all Ages, Places, and Perſons almoſt, and will continue to the End of the World; ſo that a Magiſtrate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, like the Balance, (the Symbol of his Office,) inclines to that ſide where moſt is receiv'd: So that a ſmall quantity of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, if of the heavieſt kind eſpecially, will quickly turn the Scales. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was a Man of great Boldneſs, of excellent Parts, and for a great while an uncorrupted Patriot of his Country's Liberties and Properties, no doubt; for by the Force purely of his Speeches he kept the <hi>Athenian</hi> Senate ſteady to their Intereſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Intrigues and Inſinuations of a ſubtile and aſpiring Prince, who, under ſhew of defending the Weaker againſt the Stronger, actually enſlav'd moſt of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. But no ſoft, cankery Speeches of <hi>Philip</hi> could move <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> for he was as good or better at that Trade than the King. But <hi>Alexander</hi> his Succeſſor took another Method: For ſending <hi>Harpalus</hi> his Embaſſador to <hi>Athens,</hi> with a vaſt Treaſure, and Preſents of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Value, many of the Senate were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd by theſe means, the chiefeſt of which was <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> their Orator, upon the Wheels of whoſe Tongue their Government ſeem'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

turn: For as the Embaſſador was putting his Retinue and Baggage aſhore, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> caſt his Eye upon a certain Veſſel, curious for the Workmanſhip as well as the Matter of which 'twas made; which the Orator could not forbear to admire and commend; which <hi>Harpalus</hi> obſerving, and judging by his Eye the Pulſe and Bent of his Heart, ſends it him ſecretly at Night full of Gold, the Luſtre whereof could not be withſtood by our Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor But his Treaſon being diſcovered, he was brought before the <hi>Areopogites,</hi> and condemn'd to pay Fifty Talents, and to be ſent to Priſon, from whence he eſcap'd by Flight. The ſame Orator at another time was brib'd by the <hi>Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teans,</hi> and being call'd upon to harangue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly againſt them, he entred the Senate with his Neck wrapp'd about with a great many Cloths of Flannel, pretending that he had a Quinſie or Soreneſs in his Throat; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome made this S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

From whence we may obſerve, that in the beſt of Times and of Governments there were ſome, who, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be the Defenders of their Country's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, turn'd Penſioners to thoſe who would have undermined them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Worthies, whoſe Works or Monuments are at this Day extant, there is none more eminent than <hi>Seneca;</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for his Excellent Books of Morality, a

Profeſs'd <hi>Stoick,</hi> or one who placed Happineſs in the Exerciſe of Vertue, and in the Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Paſſions; and famous likewiſe for his Death which he receiv'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Nero,</hi> whoſe Tutor ſometimes he had been: And yet we find this Man of Morals to have been accus'd for Bribery, or perve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And truly, if we conſider the vaſt Treaſure which he ſcrap'd together, and which was ſeiz'd upon and confiſcated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Death, (which, if ſome Reports be true, amounted not to much leſs than to a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of our Money,) I know not how we ſhall preſerve a due Honour for the Memory of this Great Man, unleſs we ſay, That <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> the Philoſopher was a very good Man, but that <hi>Seneca</hi> the Courtier was a ſuſpected Perſon.</p>
               <p>To paſs by <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and others of the Ancients, who were tainted with this Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; we have an Example of one in our own Kingdom, who had the Misfortune to fall under the <note place="margin">The Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Bacon.</hi>
                  </note> like Suſpicion; one who was great for his Place and Figure in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but much more great for his Learning, and was remov'd from his Employment upon the like Charge of Corruption: So that this great Perſonage ſeems to tell us (in an Epiſtle-Dedicatory to Biſhop <hi>Andrews)</hi> that his Caſe had in ſome meaſure a very near Reſemblance to that of <hi>Seneca.</hi> But when we conſider the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47781:128"/>
manner of Life in this Excellent Writer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly immers'd in Philoſophical Studies, and Publiſhing of Books, leaving the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Buſineſs, for the moſt part, to his Under-Officers and other Domeſticks, upon whoſe Informations he might depend, it may reaſonably be imagin'd, by any Ingenious and Impartial Conſiderer, that many things might be carried on under his Authority which he was not privy to. However, ſo it happens, oftentimes, that the Maſter ſuffers in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for the Faults of his Servant; and yet the Maſter himſelf is not without Fault, but is guilty of great Imprudence and Breach of Truſt, in leaving that to others which he ought in Duty to execute by himſelf; ſo that Bookiſh Men ſeldom make good Men of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the former ſitting down in their Studies are taken up with the Pleaſures of Reading and of a Contemplative Life, whilſt the latter are in a perpetual Hurry and Noiſe, and (if Publick Miniſters) importun'd with infinite Petitions, and intangled with Intrigues. Nor can there be any thing ſo irkſome to a Man in his Cloſet, and amidſt the innocent Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Meditation and Reading, as to have his Door ſtill thraſh'd at by multitudes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants; a thing which might eaſily tempt a Man to remit the troubleſome part of his Charge to Deputies, that he himſelf might purſue the more natural and pleaſing part, without Diſturbance and Diſtraction, and be knock'd on the Head, poſſibly, like <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:47781:129"/>
in the midſt of his Theorems and ſandy Demonſtrations.</p>
               <p>And truly amongſt thoſe who are deſtin'd to the leſſer Wheels of Buſineſs, 'tis not rare to find one here and there of mean Fortune, but of a meaner Spirit, who covets to be in an Office, which he manages with that Prudence, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to want ſmall Timber for houſe-keeping; ſome likewiſe there are of this Tribe, who if a Complaint be brought againſt an Inferior-Fellow by one of a better Degree, 'tis five to one but he ſhews Indulgence towards the meaner Perſon. This at firſt bluſh looks like Clemency and Moderation, when in reality it's his ſorded Intereſt which tempts him to this Method: For by this means he has a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture always at his Devotion to help him poſſibly in Harveſt, or upon ſome other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: Or if an Artificer, he muſt be always at his Beck, and work at lower Rates: Beſides, a kindneſs ſhewn to an Inferior-Fellow, makes a great Noiſe, and is in all Mens Mouths, ſo that a firm Intereſt is by this means Coveted in all others of the ſame level, which is a Thing very Advantageous to make a Man Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, eſpecially in matters which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not by Weight but by Numbers; whilſt one of higher Order, when he has an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, owes no Thanks, and Conſequently no Service where he is oblig'd only to the Merits of his Cauſe, or perhaps ſtanding near upon the ſame height of Ground with his Worſhip, he cares not much to Creep and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47781:129"/>
ſneake at his Elbow. Tis not rare to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve likewiſe, how the tender-hearted Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, the good Gentlewoman of the Houſe, has a mighty Influence upon theſe Matters, inclining ſuch a Judge of differences to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate the diſtreſſed: For what tender Bowels wil not yearn with pity at the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Cries of a whole Pannel of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Complaining Children, eſpecially when their Teſtimony ſhall be ſtrengthen'd and ſupported with the weighty Evidence of a very Creditable, Upright, and Uncorrupted Sugar-Loaf.</p>
               <p>Another Qualification requiſite in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, is Courage; and this, firſt, in reſpect of the Perſons he is to judge betwixt: For as he ought not to favour a Poor Man in his Suit, in like manner ought he not to be afraid to Cenſure the Rich where there is juſt Cauſe of Complaint brought againſt him; ſo that whilſt Juſtice is blind, as to the Quality of the Perſon, it ought to be Eagle-ey'd as to the Nature of the Cauſe. In the next place, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Magiſtrate ought to ſhew his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in Relation to the Times he lives in, that is, not to be meal-mouth'd in doing what is Juſt and Honeſt, for fear of being evil look'd upon by the higher Powers. But they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are moſt inexcuſable, who, out of a timorous Nature, or out of a ſordid and ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Compliance rather with the Fortunes of the Times, in Hopes meerly to preſerve themſelves in their little Station, ſhall refuſe to Redreſs
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47781:130"/>
the Injuries of One whom malicious Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and a Rabble of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oting Ruffians, out of Hopes of Plunder, ſhall think fit to dub a Diſaffected Perſon. Should a Man, I ſay, come before ſuch a one with a Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a licentious Pack of Rogues, Mr. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice would preſently ſhrug up his Shoulders, cock his Eye-brows, and with a reſerv'd, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, and forlorn Countenance, becoming the Gravity of a Funeral, deſire the Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to forbear importuning him, till the Times were a little ſettled and quiet; telling him, that then he could be his Humble Servant moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, but that in the mean time he muſt have Patience. This is all one as if I were overtaken on the Road with violent, tempeſtuous Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and coming to my Friend's Houſe to be ſhelter'd from the Storm, he ſhould ſhut his Door upon me, ſaying, Sir, I am very ſorry to ſee you in this Condition, but you muſt pardon me; for ſhould I open the Door, the foul Weather would beat into my Houſe, and I might take wet and be ill by ſuch means; but if it pleaſe you to have a little Patience till the Storm is over, I will anſwer your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and you ſhall come into my Houſe and welcome. And ſtill would not the Caſe be worſe, were it a Publick Inn I ſhould fly unto for Relief, that is to ſay, a Place ſet apart and appointed by the Government for the Succour of the wayfaring and diſtreſſed Traveller? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Officers of Juſtice are appointed and ſet apart for the Relief of ſuch as are diſtreſſed,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47781:130"/>
and what they do by way of Relief is not Charity, but Duty and Juſtice; and failing hereof, they ought to be ſuppreſs'd as well as thoſe barbarous Inn-keepers who ſhall refuſe to accommodate an honeſt Traveller becauſe he is wounded, rifled, and perhaps tumbled in the dirt by Rogues and Robbers, upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, forſooth, leſt his own Houſe ſhould be incommoded, and receive Damage by the like Inſults from a Crew of deſperate Villains. The Truth of it is, the way to make the Times peaceable and quiet, is, to puniſh Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous and Riotous Diſorders, and not to ſuffer them to run on without Controul, till the Authors of them ſhall of themſelves think good to be civil.</p>
               <p>But what ſays my Trimmer? Why this: All things are brought about by the Will and Providence of God, and therefore ought we to comply with ſuch Diſpenſations. Beſides, there were very great Mismanagements under former Governments. We ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſtrive and tire our ſelves againſt the Tyde, leſt we be choak'd or carried Head and Heels under Water; but let us do like our Neighbours, ſwim with the Current, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our Arms wide upon the Waters, and the Flood will never hurt us, but carry us ſafe and ſmoothly to our Journey's end. The Caſe is clear. Let us e'en turn Tenants then to our new Landlord. Thus he cants in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, whilſt he mumbles at another rate within himſelf, after this manner: I value neither

ſome ſtrains of Divinity, crying as he ran along, that <hi>it was the Lord's doing to retaliate the evil which he did to the Houſe of Saul,</hi> and that he himſelf had drawn Vengeance upon his own Head, by his own Miſ-management and Tyranny: All which he yet farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd, or Preach'd up, before all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying, That <hi>the Lord hath delivered the Kingdom into the hand of Abſalon thy Son.</hi> But when it ſeem'd good to the Juſtice of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God to baffle the Prophaners or Buffooners of his Providence, by the Reſtauration of the Good King; behold! <hi>Shimei</hi> throngs in with the firſt to congratulate his Happy Return; nor doth he appear like a Mean Raſcal, but was attended with a brave Retinue of his own Tribe, having no leſs than a Thouſand <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> with him <hi>(cap.</hi> 19.) crowding in the Head of the King's Friends, even the Men of <hi>Judah;</hi> for no ſooner had the King croſs'd the Water, but <hi>Shimei</hi> greets him at his landing: The Dog which formerly ran barking and ſnapping at him on the way, now came crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fawning at the Feet of injur'd Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and licking the Sore which his own Teeth had made; ſo that his Tongue was now ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and anointed with ſoft melting and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Speeches, which before was poyſoned with virulent Imprecations.

               <p>Whether there be any Man of this Character now bearing Office I know not: But ſince 'tis certain that there have been ſuch, and moſt probable too that there may be ſuch in after Ages, if what is here written ſhall ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen into the hands of ſuch an one, let him be pleas'd to know, that notwithſtanding the Office which he may bears, which peradventure may procure him ſome little reſpect, like what of Old was given to the Aſs which carried the Image of <hi>Iſis,</hi> he is ſtill to be lookt upon
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47781:132"/>
as a thing of little Value. A Farthing, we know, whether of Braſs, or of dull pliable Lead, by reaſon of the Royal Stamp, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription it carries, may be of ſome ſmall uſe amongſt trivial Merchants, and may ſerve a little for a Change, but ſtill 'tis bue a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and when the Image and Characters are worn off (as ſoon they will be) or when the little Coin is cried down (as it happens frequently) this deſpicable bit of baſe Metal is good for nothing but to be thrown away, and trod under foot, or to be proſtituted to the Sport of Children.</p>
               <p>The laſt Qualification requiſite in a good Magiſtrate is Prudence and Moderation of his Paſſions; ſo that if this be wanting, let a Man otherwiſe be never ſo well qualified, he is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unfit to be a Moderator of Differences. 'Twas wiſely therefore ſaid by the Heathen Poet, that <hi>Prudence comprehended all the other Deities whatſoever, notwithſtanding Fortune be that Goddeſs which in the Opinion of Men is moſt or ſolely ador'd.</hi> Certain 'tis, that Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is a Complex of many excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; 'tis circumſpect and diligent, and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus-like,</hi> looks forwards and backwards: It examines things with great Attention and application of Thought, and determines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently upon mature Conſideration: It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Patience and a ſubjection of Paſſions, and by the ſteddy Bent of a vigorous Mind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the greateſt ſedateneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it reduces all its Deciſions to the Teſt and

Meaſures of Reaſon: Nor does it perform its Duty with a ſly Squint-ey'd regard to its own private Intereſt, ſailing by every Point of the Compaſs (which in the Opinion of the Worthies of the Age, is called mighty Prudence) but without collateral Reſpect and Byaſs, it is guided by Truth and Honeſty, as the ſole Magnet which attracts, or rather the Polar Star by which it ſteers its Courſe through the greateſt Depths in times of Darkneſs; all which require, I ſay, great Vigilance and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and yet withal, great ſmoothneſs of Temper, of which no Man certainly can be capable who ſuffers himſelf to be hurried eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way by his own violent and diſtracting Paſſions. Whilſt the Body is in agitation, 'tis impoſſible for the Arm to hold the Ballance ſteddy; and whilſt the Eyes ſparkle with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Rage, and the Man is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with vehemence of Choler, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to diſcern the difference in Weight; ſo that in caſes like theſe (which happen but too frequently) the Magiſtrate, whilſt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to judge another, is the Executioner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf: The Vexation and Torment which he ſuffers in his own Spirit being a far greater Puniſhment than what he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon an Offendor, beſides the ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to which he is expos'd in the Eyes of all who ſee him, which with the Train of Abſurdities thereon depending, muſt needs be a great aggravation to his Trouble, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing ſo ſharp and pungent to a Man

               <p>Thus briefly have I glanc'd upon ſome of the Qualifications which are requiſite to the Conſtitution of a good Magiſtrate: To find a Man in whom all theſe meet in full Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a thing rare, if not impoſſible; however, in ſome inferiour degree they are indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requiſite, and for want of theſe 'tis, I ſay, that the Nation falls into ſo many Diſorders, whereas were Magiſtrates ſevere and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious in the execution of their Charge, and Exemplary in themſelves, Sobriety would be in Credit, diſorderly Rogues would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; Frugality and Induſtry would lift Men above the Neceſſities of Life into a Region of Plenty: Pariſhes would have their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charges leſſened, the Poor would be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, and by conſequence, Husbandry would be improv'd, Trade advanc'd, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth grow great and flouriſhing; all which are ſuch Temporal Bleſſings as cannot but make a Nation happy under the Bleſſing of Almighty God, which we cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope for, till Drunkenneſs and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

be ſeverely puniſh'd, and his Worſhip duly celebrated and honoured; for when Men ceaſe in the Performance of Religious Duties, they will ſoon degenerate from being Men.</p>
               <p>Thus it was of old, during the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e and Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and thus it was likewiſe through all the Circles of the Chriſtian Church in all its Periods and Revolutions, as was moſt deplorably and eminently conſpicuous in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, upon the Inundation of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and afterwards of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> and laſtly of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who finally ſubverted that Empire, all which was uſher'd in by the corrupt Lives of the Chriſtians, as appears by the Hiſtory of thoſe Times. The like Calamities happen'd likewiſe in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſo that rarely any Kingdom has been ſubverted and ruin'd, which had not firſt deſerted God's Worſhip, and poyſoned themſelves by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, for they go together; it being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible for a Man to be truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and yet debauch'd in his Morals as it is almoſt impoſſible for a Man to be truly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Vertuous, and yet to be Irreligious. There is no Man ſo fit for great Undertakings, as he that is a good Chriſtian. The Fears of Death cannot diſorder him ſo much as others, upon the Hopes and Proſpect he has of Future Rewards: Difficulties cannot diſmay him who is above the Temptations of Eaſe and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. His Reputation and Honour being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, he is receiv'd in all Places with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47781:135"/>
and whereever he goes, he carries along with him his Bills of Credit, which muſt needs facilitate his Enterprizes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh his Spirits: His Dealings are without Fraud, and unſuſpected, and therefore he is in a fair Poſt to advance his Fortunes: He has a vital Heat within himſelf, which gives Nature a quick and eaſie Circulation, and arms him with Man-like Reſolutions in all Caſes of Hazard and Diſtreſs, filling him with far more noble Spirits than what flow from a Bottle of Wine or Ale, which end commonly in a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Conſumption of Health, Reputation, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and of all Intellectual Gueſts whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>Nor are the Philters of good Company, with which Men are ſo willingly intoxicated, of any greater Vertue: For there can be no ſolid Friendſhip in a Debauch: It does not ſo properly cement as bedawb mens Inclinations to one another, by a kind of Ordure or ſlimy Matter, which cracks or drops off upon the leaſt ſhog and puff of Wind, or upon any Change of Weather, tho it may poſſibly keep them ſticking together for a little time; and when this dirty Copulative is disbanded, ſome Relicks of it will ſtill remain, by which they may be known to one another, as well as to all the World beſides.</p>
               <p>What is here written may be diſtaſtful poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſome, but that's a Scandal taken, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. A Horſe may winch and kick a little, whilſt the Hand gently rubs his gall'd Back; but ſtill

the fault is not in the Hand which deſigns a Cure, but in the corruption of the Beaſt; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, as ſome diſſike, others may approve of the Method: And the good word of one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſon is of more weight and value than that of a whole Jury of par-boil'd, rattle-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clod-pates (tho upon their Oaths) or of any ſpurious and degenerate Mercenary whatſoever. And God be thank'd, notwithſtanding the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Age, there are many men in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of publick, generous and untainted Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and of laudable Lives and Cuſtoms; But whilſt ſome are defective, their ill Conduct proves fatal to others: For Men (who are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclin'd to Vice) will eaſily copy after ſuch Examples as ſuit with their own Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whilſt the good, out of an innate Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, or out of fear belike, of offending their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, or for being cenſur'd poſſibly, for moroſe, formal and puritanically affected, ſuffer the bad to run on in their full Career, without confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or ſhewing any viſible diſlike of their looſe behaviour.

               <p>NOW to make a Summary of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ſhall humbly offer two Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to which, if due Regard be had, they will very much contribute to the True Intereſt and Advancement of our Country-Affairs, and to the Peace and Felicity of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Firſt relates to that great Community or Body-Repreſentative in the Lower Houſe of Parliament; the Members of which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate are, as I may ſay, our Deputies, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected out of the Number of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Freeholders, and Citizens, tho' we find them many times to be dignified with Titles and Offices, and to be Conſiderable by their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>The long Continuance of the ſame Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been by Experience found to be of ill Conſequence to the Country; for ſuch Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ripen, or rather are corrupted into Parties and laſting Factions; and the Popular and Leading Men of them being won over by Penſions and Offices, to ſlacken their Adherence to the Country's Intereſt, look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as petty Lords or Princes in the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Places for which they pretend to ſerve.</p>
               <p>Another Corruption altogether as miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, is the Expenſive and Scandalous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47781:136"/>
of Voices by Drinking-Entertainments, and other Illegal Methods: Of both theſe I had made Enlargements, when this Subject firſt enter'd into my Thoughts. But ſince it hath pleaſed the Houſe of Commons to make ſome Steps towards their own Reformation, I ſhall not farther touch upon it, hoping that they will make themſelves truly Honourable and Revereable, by making a further Progreſs in the Reformation of ſome other Matters, which, in the Opinions of honeſt and impartial Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Country, ſeem very much to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct its true Intereſt and Tranquility.</p>
               <p>Prerogative and Privilege are the two Hinges upon which the Frame of Government does turn, which when duly fix'd, all things open and ſhut with eaſe; but when one of theſe Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is plac'd too high, or is too ſtrong for the other, the Frame moves with Difficulty and is in danger of falling. Upon which Account it is, that aſpiring and buſie Perſons are moſt pernicious to the Publick Welfare. It has been heretofore, and probably may be their Method for the future, to cry up the Liberty and Privilege of the Subject, and to declaim againſt Arbitrary Power, and by Popular Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations to draw on the Weak and Credulous to their Parties: But when once theſe Zealous Patriots can get a Retaining Fee from the Crown, then out Nettle in Dock; none more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Promoters of Prerogative (even to the utmoſt Stretch) than theſe Proſelytes: Whilſt ſuch as cannot be gratified to the Extent of their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47781:137"/>
Deſires (which generally are inſatiable) erect their Standards of Defiance, and become moſt furious Incendiaries, and make their firſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries upon Sovereignty, by pretending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Church-Government, and of adhering, forſooth, to the Peoples Safety both as to their Religion and Property.

               <p>It has been the Opinion of a great many ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Men, That if one half of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Acts were repeal'd, and if there were a Digeſt or an Abridgment made of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, pruning off the Suckers, and leaving what is neceſſary and ſubſtantial, and which might be ſo couch'd as might be obvious to moſt Capacities, 'twould be the beſt Work ſuch an Honourable and Auguſt Aſſembly could ever undertake: For doubtleſs 'tis expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for every Subject to underſtand the Laws by which he is to govern his Life and Actions, and not fall unadviſedly into a Snare, or have recourſe to others who may make a Prey upon his Ignorance; or rack himſelf beyond the Port of his Capacity and Private Fortune, to purchaſe vaſt Volumes of Statutes, or

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tus, <hi>downwards, there was ſuch a Race of Wit and Authority between the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries and Deciſions of the Lawyers, as both Laws and Lawyers were out of breath.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> tho' a Prince of no great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity himſelf, by the Advice and Diligence of <hi>Tribonean,</hi> an excellent Lawyer, taking in other Learned Men in that Faculty, made a Body of Laws, ſuch as might be weilded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compil'd out of the Ancient Ruines of Books as Materials, making Novel Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo of his own.</p>
               <p>The firſt Emperor we read of, who did make an Attempt of this Nature, was <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> II. who caus'd a <hi>Code</hi> to be compil'd by many Judicious and Learned Perſons; but ſo
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47781:139"/>
it was, that his Conſtitutions did extend no farther than the Times of Chriſtianity, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great: Whereas <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi>'s Body of Laws was of a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, being compil'd more eſpecially out of the Collections or <hi>Codes</hi> of <hi>Gregorius, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ſo taking in all the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Laws.</p>
               <p>The firſt who in this Iſland did attempt the Reducing the Laws into a Body, was King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> by which he made himſelf more famous than by failing round this Iſland with a Fleet, or his <hi>Quatuor Maria Vindico.</hi> Nor was there any thing for which <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> the Ninth of that Name, King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was Sirnamed <hi>the Wiſe,</hi> as from his compiling a Digeſt of the Laws of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be very convenient if ſuch a Drught of a Digeſt to be made of our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Laws, were printed and perus'd by all Men; for, no doubt, there are great Numbers of underſtanding and unbiaſs'd Men, who do not ſit in the Lower Houſe; and tho' they cannot make a definitive, may make a diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Judgment as well as any Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and by making their Objections, the whole Project would be winnowed and ſifted throughly, and left to the Decree of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Senate, to give it the Authentick and Indelible Stamp of a Univerſal and Standing Law, purg'd from all Doubts which might ariſe from unforeſeen Errors; which would
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:47781:139"/>
be a thing of wonderful Satisfaction to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who ought to be govern'd by ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions as are fully, freely, and deliberately examin'd, and ſo Beneficial to all; which would prevent ſo many Repeals of Statutes as we meet with every where, to the great leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening of the Wiſdom of thoſe by whom they were enacted; and ſo diminiſhing of that Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Honour due to the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon their being ſo defective and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Alteration. Upon this Conſideration the foreſaid <hi>Verulam</hi> tells us, from that Report of <hi>Aeſchynes,</hi> That in <hi>Athens</hi> there was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Six, who, as ſtanding Commiſſioners, did watch to diſcover what Laws waxed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for the Times, and what new ones did in any Branch croſs the former; and ſo <hi>ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio</hi> did propound their Repeal in order to make theſe Conſtitutions more refin'd and laſting. A Work of this nature would be well worthy the Care and Encouragement of a Prince, and would repreſent him to after-Ages more glorious and radient than all the Luſtre of his Arms and ſmoaky Atchievements can ever pretend to do.</p>
               <p>It would be likewiſe very Satisfactory to the Country, if the Gentry and Citizens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went to an Election, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to the Candidates the Grievances of the Nation, and of the Countreys and Cities in which they liv'd; for by this means the Electors would be better inform'd who they
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:47781:140"/>
were about to chooſe, as alſo the Elected, what was expedient and agreeable to the Kingdoms Exigence, and for the Relief of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſh'd alſo that ſuch Members of Parliament as were appointed to inſpect and ſtate the Publick Accounts, ſhould make what they have done this way Publick, either by printing or by cauſing it to be enter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Parliament-Rolls and Records; there being no hing more rational, than that they, who freely open their Purſes for the Good and Welfare of the Kingdom, ſhould, for their better Encouragement in future Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, underſtand a little the Methods of Paſt Disburſements.</p>
               <p>The way of Voting by Balls, (as ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the <hi>Romans</hi> by Stones, where caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of a White Stone into the Cheſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Grace, as the Black Stones the contrary,) I ſay, this way of Baloting is an Excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention well worthy the Greatneſs of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Republick, in which 'tis practis'd. When the Senators or Council meet in the Doge's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, there is a cloſe, deep, double Box of two Colours, with a common Hole or Orifice at top, into which a Man putting his Hand may reach the Mouth of either Partition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſcern'd, into which ſide he puts a little Ball about the bigneſs of a Button. Two of theſe little Balls, which are made of Cotton, and ſo ſoft that no Man can hear into which ſide of the double Box they fall, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:47781:140"/>
to every Senator when he comes up to give his Vote, (of which Balls one is White and the other Red; the one ſignifying the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the other the Negative Vote,) and when they have thus one by one put in their Balls, the Boxes are unlock'd and open'd before them all. By this means Men give their Votes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, without being known which ſide they took, and without Danger of being call'd to an Account afterwards, or of being aw'd and drawn in by the Examples of others; as it happens to the contrary with us, where a few leading Perſons influences rhe reſt, and ſo draw all into Cabals and Parties. Were this way of Baloting practis'd in <hi>England,</hi> the Topping-Men (as they call them) would ſignifie little, as likewiſe the winding Methods of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Partiſans; for, after all, every Man might Vote according to his Conſcience, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever being known or mark'd for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The other Grand Conſideration which I have to offer on the Behalf of the Country, in order to make it Happy, relates to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Tribunals or Courts of Juſtice, thoſe I mean more eſpecially which regard the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature of Counties, as the Aſſizes of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits: And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It might be wiſh'd that the Judges who preſide in Caſes Criminal, might be Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and not Itinerant; that is, ſuch as reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſtantly in the Capital Town of a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47781:141"/>
County, might have power to hear and paſs Sentence upon Offenders, holding ſuch Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (as in <hi>London)</hi> once a Month at leaſt.</p>
               <p>The Diſadvantages of Keeping Malefactors in Goal half a Year are very great. And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In Reſpect of the Goalor, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Swarm of Rogues for ſo long a time under his Cuſtody, runs great Hazards in caſe of an Eſcape; which often happens where ſo many deſperate Wretches are to be provided for and guarded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In Reſpect of the Priſoners themſelves, who, if Innocent, endure too rigorous a Puniſhment by ſo lo long a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement and Hardſhip; if Guilty, they do but encourage one another in their Rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and when ſo many Villains of all Sizes and Complexions hold a Convention, they contract an Intimacy; and, by recounting the Feats of their paſt Lives, and by inſtructing one another, they become Ten times more the Children of the Devil than before: So that once a Goal-Bird, and ever a Rogue. And even ſuch as have the Misfortune to be Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd up with ſuch Infernal Company, tho' leſs Guilty, or perhaps Innocent, cannot but receive, by long Cuſtom and Converſation, an odd Smell and Tincture from them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of the Expences the County is at for maintaining ſuch Felons.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In reſpect of the Opportunities ſuch long Confinements give them, either to corrupt Officers by the Mediation of Money or
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:47781:141"/>
Friends, or by forging Stories, and by ſuborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witneſſes, by which they may make their Eſcape.</p>
               <p>And, Laſtly, the Streightneſs of Time, by which ſuch Itinerant Judges are confin'd to a Day, makes ſuch Cauſes to be curſorily run over; whereas a Thing of that Mom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt, as Life and Death, wherein the Safety of the Country, the Honour of the Government, and the Fortune of the Priſoner, are ſo deeply concern'd, ought to be examin'd with Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Caution: All which Miſchiefs are fully releiv'd by fixing Judges Criminal in every Capital City; and the frequent Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Examples of Puniſhment, tho' ſingle, would be a greater Terror to the Spectators than that of an Execution once or twice in a Year.</p>
               <p>Another thing for which the Country ſeems to call for Relief, is the Miſcarriages of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, who being for the moſt part of the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry, Mercenary and Ignorant, and having no Good-liking of the Gentry, who are their Betters, are very Incompetent Judges of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences wherein a Gentleman is concern'd. Such Trials therefore, if they were <hi>pen Pares,</hi> would be more conſonant to the Rules of Equity; that is to ſay, where the Controverſie is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gentlemen, the Jury might be only of Gentlemen. When one of the Parties is a Gentleman, the other of the Yeomanary, the Jury might be half of one, half of the other Order; and where both Parties are of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47781:142"/>
Yeomanary, 'twould be congruous that the Jury ſhould be of the ſame Alloy.</p>
               <p>In the Third place, that the Proſecutor of a Felon, in caſe of Conviction, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Charges by paying of Fees, and I know not what: For what Encouragement is there for a Man, whoſe Houſe is Broke-open and Robb'd perhaps of 30 or 40 Shillings worth of Goods, to throw 5 or 10 Pounds after it, to have him Try'd, and perhaps Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted? Upon which Score it is, that moſt Perſons chooſe raher to Compound in Private with ſuch Felons, than be at farther Coſts to Proſecute ſuch Offenders; which is but to give a farther Encouragement for the Practice of Villany, to the Diſgrace of Juſtice. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if all the Forfeitures, Penalties, Fines, and Amerciaments ariſing from this Topick, and other ſuch-like Miſdemeanours, were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for the benefit of the Place in which the Offence was committed, for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Priſoners, and for other Publick U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 'twould be an Excellent Proviſion for the Inhabitants of ſuch Places, and make them watchful to obſerve Miſcarriages, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form againſt them; which would be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Means to make Men ſtudy to avoid them by their Good Behaviour.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe Robbing of Houſes in the Day-time ought to be made Capital and Puniſhable with Death; which thing is moſt Juſt and Equitable, as being many times more heinous than Burglary: For a Man who breaks a
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47781:142"/>
Dwelling-Houſe in the Night-time, and ſteals Proviſion and Goods, tho' of ſmall value, is ſentenc'd to be hang'd; when yet a Company of Ruffians, who ſhall ruſh violently into my Houſe, binding Me and my Servants, and breaking-open Doors and Trunks, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away a very Conſiderable Booty, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a more favourable Iſſue: And yet this latter Crime is much more audacious, more unavoidable, and many times more fatal. It is not every petty Pilfering or Filtching which ought to come under this Denomination, but theſe more violent Attempts, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſeiz'd, and under Terrors; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Deliberate and wilful Perjury is certainly the greateſt Sin that can be committed againſt God and Man.</p>
               <p>And firſt againſt God: For if the perjur'd Perſon believes there is no God, he is guilty of Atheiſm; but if he believes there is a God, and yet makes uſe of the Deity to atteſt a Lye, and to abett a Falſhood, by which the Life and Fortune of an Innocent Perſon may be deſtroy'd, he does, as much as in him lies, faſten the Murder or Ruine of ſuch an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47781:143"/>
Perſon upon God, than which nothing can be more deviliſh and impious.</p>
               <p>The Heinouſneſs of Perjury, in reſpect of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, may be conſidered,</p>
               <p>1ſt. In reſpect of the Innocent Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd; by which he may loſe his Good Name, or his Intereſt and Fortune may be wounded, or perhaps he may be depriv'd of Life: So that in this Reſpect it may be term'd Robbery, or Murder, or Both.</p>
               <p>2dly, In reſpect of the Perjur'd Perſon: It is for a Man formally and ſolemnly to abjure God, and damn his own Soul; for he deſires God ſo far to ſave him by the Contents of his Holy Goſpel, as the Thing he ſwears to is true; which in his own Heart he knowing to be falſe, he obliges and conjures God to damn him by the Contents of his Word.</p>
               <p>3dly, In reſpect of Humane Society: For it cuts off all means to end Controverſies; for an Oath is ſaid to be the End of Strife, and many times, where falſe, it involves whole Kingdoms in Ruines, of which there are ſo many Examples before our Eyes. So that if the Puniſhment due to an Offence ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurated to the Damage a Man ſuſtains by it, Temporal Death is too little for it; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Diſhonour done to Almighty God, Eternal Damnation is juſtly due unto it. Now to prove a Perſon perjur'd, where the Subſtance of the Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Perſons ſwearing to the contrary; for they who ſwear <hi>Con</hi> may ſwear falſly as well as thoſe who ſwear <hi>Pro,</hi> as is found frequently before Courts of Judicature.

            <head>AN ESSAY <hi>Of a Country Houſe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BY a Country-Houſe I do not underſtand a Farm, nor the ordinary Manſion-Houſe of a Country Gentleman; nor yet a <hi>Villa,</hi> or little Houſe of Pleaſure and Retreat, where Gentlemen and Citizens betake themſelves in the Summer for their private Diverſion, there to paſs an Evening or two, or perhaps a Week, in the Converſation of a Friend or two, in ſome neat little Houſe amidſt a Vineyard or Garden, ſequeſtred from the Noiſe of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Embarras and Deſtraction of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or perhaps the anxious and ſervile At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of a Court. By a Country-Houſe then, I underſtand a greater Fabrick, fit to lodge a Nobleman endu'd with ample For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and a vertuous Mind, where he may ſweeten the Travels of a Vexations Life, and paſs away his Days amidſt the ſolid and ſerene Enjoyments of the Country.</p>
            <p>The Place or Seat of a Houſe being a thing wherein Fancy muſt have a ſhare, and the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47781:146"/>
Fancies of Men being very various and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, 'twill be difficult to Caſt an Eſſay of this Nature into ſuch a Mould as ſhall pleaſe the Curioſities of all Men. Some have taken delight to raiſe Stately Houſes or Caſtles on the top of ſome Rock or Eminence, as it were hanging over, or at leaſt over-looking ſome noble River, as the Caſtles of <hi>Nottingham, Warwick, Windſor,</hi> and the like. True it is, that ſuch Seats have a moſt beautiful Proſpect, an excellent Air, and the under-running Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is a thing of great Ornament and Uſe; but then 'tis as true too, that they are too much expos'd to the Heats of Summer, and to the Blaſts of Winter: they want Out-let, and rarely enjoy ſuch a temper'd Earth, or Soil, as is requiſite for a Garden; nor can they well be beautified by Fountains, which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conduce very much, and are in a manner eſſential to a Noble Houſe.</p>
            <p>Others again pleaſe their Fancies by build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Valley, upon the Bank of (or near) a River; for by this means they are ſheltred from the violence of Cold Winds and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Storms, and enjoy the pleaſant views of verdant Meadows; ſo that a beautiful Houſe ſeated upon the Bank of a clear-runing River, waſhing the Walls of the Terras in the Gardens, and ſtor'd with Swans, is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, as it is alſo to be refreſh'd in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Evenings, by taking a Turn or two upon the Chriſtal Streams in ſome little Bark or Pleaſure-Boat. But withal, ſuch Seats are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:47781:146"/>
many times by Floods, nor is the Air ſo wholeſome, eſpecially in the Winter, being too much ſubject to Foggs and watry Vapours; nor do they afford that pleaſure to the Eye as a Houſe built on the ſide of a Hill, over-looking the neighbouring Plains, and whoſe Proſpect is terminated by other Hills at a greater diſtance: For a Seat which has nothing but the wide Plain for its object, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords but little pleaſure to the Eye (it being here as upon the Sea) where the level of the Surface determines the ſight to a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<hi>:</hi> Upon which account I cannot ſee why <hi>Verſailles</hi> ſhould be lookt upon to be ſo fine a Seat, there lying nothing but dead Plains beyond it, in which the ſight, I ſay, is ſoon loſt, receiving in but little Variety, in the ſame manner as it happens to thoſe, who being on Ship-board, cannot ſee a League a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, unleſs ſome Ship or Land-Mark ſtanding above the level of the Eye, lengthen out the Proſpect.</p>
            <p>The Old <hi>Romans</hi> generally took much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to build their Pleaſure-Houſes near the Sea, as appears by the Ruines at this day ſeen near <hi>Baiae</hi> and <hi>Gaeta.</hi> This probably they did for the benefit of the Breezes, which at ſome certain times of the day, blow always from the Seas with univerſal Refreſhment; tho 'tis probable too, that the great Road for all their Military Expeditions, as well as to their Naval Magazines, lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> which was the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary alſo of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Nobility and Gentry
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:47781:147"/>
were more inclin'd to chooſe ſuch Places for their Retirement and Recreation, as lay near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the Road of Buſineſs; ſo that they were always in a readineſs to change from one line to another, upon any ſudden occaſion, and with little trouble. The great Caſcades or Falls of Water from a Precipice, which we obſerve frequently in <hi>Italy,</hi> occaſion'd prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by the diſſolution of the Snow on the high Mountains in the Summer Seaſons, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded noble advantages for Summer-Seats. Hence it was that <hi>Tuſculum</hi> and <hi>Tyber</hi> were then eſteem'd as places of great Delight, as they are alſo at this very day under the Names of <hi>Friſcati</hi> and <hi>Tinoli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince we have not theſe natural Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, we muſt be contented with ſuch as our Climate and Country do afford. Firſt then, we muſt have regard to the Air, that it be open, not Perd nor ſubject to Fogs and Miſts. In the next place, let the Soil be dry, ſandy or Gravelly, and <hi>ſur le Parchant,</hi> on the ſide of a Ground gently riſing, not amongſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, but in a champaign, open Country; and if a Navigable River ran within Two or Three Miles of the place, 'twould be very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious in many reſpects, and if nearer at hand, it would much contribute to the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Proſpect of the Seat; but above all, I hold it abſolutely neceſſary, that it ſhould be ſerv'd with ſome little Rivolet, or copious ſource of clear and wholſome Water, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the higher Grounds, behind the place
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:47781:147"/>
on which the Houſe is deſigned to be erected; the uſes whereof I ſhall ſpeak to hereafter. As for good Neighbours, (a Circumſtance much conducing to ſweeten the Tediouſneſs of too much Solitude) I ſuppoſe my Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be in ſuch a Range of Fortune, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Power, or by his generous Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather, to be able to draw them to his Seat, or if theſe be wanting, yet to be Maſter of ſo much Fortune, as to be able to compaſs within his own Family and Teritory, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Mind endued with Moderation, can reaſonably deſire. And as for the Site and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of ſuch a Seat as I am going now to deſcribe, there are many Noblemen and Gentlemen in this Kingdom, who have all the Natural Advantages imaginable for a Prince-like Habitation.</p>
            <p>In purſuance therefore of ſuch a Draught, I ſhall reduce my Project under Two General Deſigns or Heads. The Firſt ſhall be that of the Main Building or Habitation it ſelf; the Second ſhall be that of the Farm or Village thereon depending, and by which the great Manſion-Houſe may be ſupplied with Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as likewiſe with Labourers upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Firſt then, for the Manſion-Houſe it ſelf, let it be ſeated in the midſt of a large Park, the Ground gently riſing, and facing the <hi>South,</hi> or at leaſt the Morning Sun. I would have the Park to be at the leaſt a Mile and an half over every way, which I thus divide, <hi>viz.</hi> half a Mile for the Approach or Avenue to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:47781:148"/>
the Houſe, half a Mile for the Houſes, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and Lawnes invironing the principal Manſion; and half a Mile behind the Houſe for Out-let.</p>
            <p>All the Ground betwixt the Entrance of this Incloſure or Park, and the ſecond Region alotted for the Dwelling-Houſe, I would have planted with Trees, and above all with Beech, if the Soil will admit; or if the Place be already planted, and in the form of a Wood, I would have a large Walk or Road, of Thirty Paces breadth, leading directly from the Entrance of the Park to the Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Houſe, which I would have to ſtand in full front or view; which Walk or Road I would have regularly pitch'd for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able breadth, to prevent the Dirt which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intercourſe of Horſes and Carriages might make. On each ſide of which Ground-walk I would have private Foot-walks within the Wood, well gravell'd, or clean kept, in breadth of about Sixteen Foot each, which, like a dark Arbour-walk, ſhould butt directly upon the corners of the front in the Dwelling-Houſe; ſo that the Trees meeting at the top, would make it wonderful cool and delightful in the Summer, the long Shade-alleys or Glades being terminated in the building. But in caſe it may be thought that ſuch Walks or Glades through Woods might hinder the View and Proſpect of the Houſe, the Avenue or Approach may be caſt into a Figure ſomething reſembling a Theatre; in which caſe we may
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:47781:148"/>
allow what wideneſs we pleaſe, provided ſtill that the principal Manſion, with all its Courts, Gardens, Out-buildings, and Offices, ſtand full in front to the Entrance, the ſhady Groves regularly contracting themſelves the nearer Approach we make unto it. By this means the Palace will be ſeen at a vaſt diſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſerve or Mask upon its Face, reſembling the ſame ſtately Canopy at the head of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing Woods. But whatſoever Fancy may be pitch'd upon, this muſt carefully be taken heed to, that the tops of the Trees do not riſe higher than the Rooms upon the firſt Floor, to the hinderance of Air and Proſpect; and it may eaſily be allow'd that they will not, conſidering that the Houſe is to be built upon a Riſing Ground, and at ſome diſtance from the tending Woods.</p>
            <p>As for the Manſion-Seat, or Dwelling-Houſe, let it be erected in the midſt of that internal or middle-Region, before-allotted, in the Figure of a Square or <hi>Saxon</hi>

               </gap>, the ſtreight line or Baſis joining the two ſides, which we call the Front, to be a double Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to be One hundred ninety four Feet in Breadth, and Sixty Foot in Depth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, therein comprehending the Walls, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and Chimneys, for all which there muſt be an Allowance proportionable to ſuch a Deſign. I would have the firſt Floor on the Front-ſide to be at leaſt Four Foot above Ground; and the firſt Floor on the two wings or ſides to be about Three Foot, or
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:47781:149"/>
ſomething leſſer, above the Ground, aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the under-Region for Kitchens, Pantries, Larders, Cellars, Paſtry-Rooms, Store-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Diſtillatories, Landring-Rooms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo for Lodging-Rooms for ſome of the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Domeſticks. As for Brew-Houſes, Bake-Houſes, and the like, I ſhall provide for them in another place.</p>
            <p>I would have the Houſe divided into two grand Apartments, perfectly the ſame in all Reſpects, as to form and number of Rooms, excepting only a convenient Room for a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to be taken out of one ſide; of which anon. Let the whole Fabrick then conſiſt of, 1ſt. Vaulted Rooms, at leaſt Nine Foot high, and of this Four Foot above Ground: 2dly, The Ground or Lower-Floor: 3dly, The Chamber-Floor, or Rooms of State: and, 4thly, The upper-Floor. As to the heighth, the firſt Courſe of Rooms in the front, in which we land, ought to be Fifteen Foot hight, he next likewiſe Fifteen Foot, and the upper-Story, or Roof-Floor, to be Twelve Foot high; ſo that the Front, from the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to the Roof, with Allowance for the Thickneſs of the Floors, will be near upon Fifty Foot high. I would have likewiſe Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Windows in the Front, Seven on a ſide, each Window to be Six Foot wide in the clear, and Nine Foot high; and ſo they will be Six Foot diſtant from one another. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Front I allow Twelve Foot for the Breadth of the Thorough-Paſſage; and I
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47781:149"/>
would have the whole Orchard fair of the Front, I mean in the Roof, to be caſt into this form, <hi>viz.</hi> Three Pavilions, one in the middle, and one at each end, reſembling Three <hi>Cupola's,</hi> not round, but rather in a Canopy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. For Decoration, I would have betwixt all the Windows, Columns on their Baſis, reaching from the Ground to the Roof, and ſuſtaining a ſuitable Corniſh; the Pillars to be in Number Fourteen, anſwering the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the Windows; and on the Corniſh over every Pillar I would have a Statue of proportionable bigneſs, <hi>a la Romaneſque,</hi> as a <hi>Gladdiator,</hi> a <hi>Hercules</hi> killing the <hi>Hydra,</hi> with ſuch-like Figures as repreſent Action or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But in regard that Pillars in their full Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, or proportionable to the heighth given, will be vaſtly big and expenſive, and conſequently darken all the Windows in the Front, (for ſuch Pillars in their full Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are rarely to be ſeen, but under the Roof of Portico's in vaſt Fabricks, ſuſtaining great Weights, and ſtanding at ſome diſtance from the Lights,) I would have the Pillars in this Deſign, being ſuch as are for Decoration rather than for Uſe, to ſtand ſwelling a little out of the Building, in <hi>relievo,</hi> more full or ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as the Architect ſhall think fit: Or in caſe they be made entire, they may be of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Orders, riſing betwixt revery Stage or Story in the Front, and then they will be of ſuch a ſize as will not much hinder the Light
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47781:150"/>
or Proſpect. However, I hold the former Deſign or Decoration, by Pillar-work, as in a <hi>Baſſo Relievo,</hi> ſwelling out of the Walls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Windows of the Front, to be more beautiful than the ſeveral Orders of leſſer Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns ſtanding out entire, becauſe we have the Beauty of Greatneſs without any Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and with leſs Expence.</p>
            <p>Over the Portal or Entrance, which muſt be aſcended by double-winding Stairs, of eight or ten Degrees, I would have a ſtately Balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny looking full in the Grand Avenue, over which an Architrane ſupported by Pillar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and garniſhed above with Imagery in <hi>Relievo;</hi> the Roof on the Front-ſide to be leaded, as alſo the Arches, to weather the Windows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let the Coins or Corners of the Front, as likewiſe the Stone-Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Grand Apartments, or about the Portal, be of great ſquare Stones, cut and ſet <hi>a la Ruſtique;</hi> and on the top of all, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over the Entrance, and in the midſt of the Statues, but ſomething higher, a <hi>Statua Equeſtris,</hi> or ſome Trophy; as likewiſe a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria alata,</hi> at each corner of the Front, would look very great and noble: And becauſe the Front is ſuppos'd to be a double Building, the Roof towards the top ought to be flatned and leaded, and incircled with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſters, with ſome Figures for Ornament here and there, conveniently ſtanding on them. Such flat Roofs likewiſe are very Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for Air and Proſpect in the Summer-Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47781:150"/>
as likewiſe in the Winter-Seaſons, when the Days are calm and ſerene.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Diſtribution of the inward parts of this Front, ſuppoſing, as I ſaid, that it be a double Building, at the leaſt Sixty Foot in the Traverſe, of which Twelve Feet for the but Walls and middle Partitions, whereon to raiſe Chimneys, and ſupport the Roof, let the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e be, in the firſt place, two double-Gates for the Entrance, one of Grate or Inn-work, for the benefit of the Air and Breezes in the Summer; the other an inward Gate or Door of Wood to keep out the Winter-Winds: Oppoſite whereunto, at the end of the Paſſage which does traverſe the Houſe, let there be two other Doors likewiſe of the ſame Figure, Matter, and Dimenſions with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, giving an open View through the Houſe, Inner-Court, Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this not only to pleaſe the Eye, but to refreſh and cool the Houſe in hot Seaſons; for ſuch Thorough-Paſſages ſuck in the Air in a full Stream, of which more hereafter. Likewiſe, touching the Front, as alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he other two ſides of the Fabrick, conſiſting of two Grand Apar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the Front or Entrance-ſide therefore, as ſoon as we land, let there be on the one hand a Hall, or Common Reception Room, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>adth twenty four Foot, in length thirty

ſix Feet, beſides the breadth of that ſpace which was allowd for the Croſs-Paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Grate-Doors; by which means the Hall, with the Addition of the Paſſage, will be forty eight Feet in length, that is to ſay, double to the breadth; which may ſeem perhaps ſomething diſproportionable, but this may be diſguis'd by a Screen, or otherways. Within the Hall let there be a Parlour or Room of Conference, ſquare twenty four feet; and within this let there be an inward Parlour, or Room of Reflexion, of the ſame Dimenſions, which will be very light, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Corner-Room, and ſo it muſt have Windows on two ſides; of all which three Rooms I would have the Doors plac'd directly one againſt the other, and to be rather on the Window-ſide than in the middle of the Room. It being likewiſe ſuppos'd to be a double-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on the ſide of the inward Parlour I would have a Withdrawing-Room; and on the ſide of the middle Parlour, or Room of Conference, I would have a Winter-Parlour, or Room of Reflexion, which will fall out to be of leſs Dimenſions than the reſt, and therefore warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more private; and for this there will be ſpace enough and to ſpare towards our Privyl Stairs, which we ſhall come to by and by: And laſtly, on the Hall-ſide there will be another convenient Room for Entertainment, or for any other uſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Now for the Grand Stairs, I would have them double, and plac'd near the farther Door,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:47781:151"/>
oppoſite to the Entrance; and for each of theſe there is allow'd twenty four Feet one way; and ſixteen another; ſo that the Grand Floor or Entrance being to be added to it, the Area of each Aſcent will be twenty four Foot ſquare, and the Steps or Degrees will be near upon eight Feet in length. I would have the Rails of the Stairs to be Iron-work caſt into Figures, or Devices, and Cyphers, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be laid in Oil to prevent Ruſt, and to be gilt in convenient Places; as alſo on the Walls of the Stairs, and of the Hall, let there be large Hiſtory-Paintings, as of Huntings, Battles, Carouſels, and the like, and here and there ſome Statues on their Pedeſtals, or Buſts in Niches.</p>
            <p>The upper-Floor of the Front is for Rooms of State, as Antichambers, Chambers, With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing-Rooms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Paſſage or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on which we land at the top of the Stairs of the firſt Floor, will be of the ſame Dimenſions with the Paſſage or Entrance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, <hi>viz.</hi> ſixty feet in length, and twelve in breadth, at each end whereof let there be a ſtately Balcony-Window, one opening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the outward Courts and Avenue of the Houſe, from whence you may behold the Park and Country below you; the other gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> Window will open to the inward Court, from whence we have a View likewiſe of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Fountains, and of the Country which lies about the Houſe: At each of theſe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in the Balconys, let there be plac'd fair
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47781:152"/>
Orange-Trees in their Caſes, which, when the Windows are ſet open, will, with the Air that is drawn in, ſend their Perfumes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gallery or Walk, as alſo to the border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chambers, with wonderful Pleaſure and Refreſhment. The Walls of this Croſs-Walk or Gallery, I would have adorn'd with all ſorts of Landskip, as Boſcage, Payſarge, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, Promontories, Buildings, Towns, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Sea-Battles, Sports or Wakes of Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo ſome curious Cabinets and ſome Statues would much adorn it.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of the Grand Apartment below, and oppoſite to the Common Hall I would have a Private Chapel, twenty four Feet in breadth, and in length thirty ſix Feet, and about thirty Foot in heigth, being the heighth which was aſſign'd for the Lower and Middle-Stories, with an over-hanging Gallery iſſuing out of the Walls or Paſſage of the middle-Story, before-mentioned: As for the Ornaments of the Chapel, that's a Thing which muſt be left to the Genius of the Lord of it.</p>
            <p>And as for the upper Region of the Front, on the ſide which regards the Park or Entrance, there ſhould be a fair long Gallery; at one end whereof I would have a Library, with a Repoſitory for the Deeds and Writings of my Lord's Eſtates and Manors. The inward-ſide of this upper-Floor ſhould be for Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Rooms, and the ſide-Walls of the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be adorn'd with the Pictures of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47781:152"/>
as alſo of Brave and Learned Men; to which we may add Statues, and Rarities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Art or Nature, with Cabinets and Monuments of Antiquity, with Maps and Platforms of Fortification, with all ſorts of Engines and Machines in leſſer Forms; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with the rareſt Prints, with inlay'd-Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and Tables, whether of Stone or Wood, by Materials of the Natural Colour; and ſome Originals or good Copies of the beſt Maſters: For as for Painting in Frieze, the Temper of our Air will not admit of it.</p>
            <p>The Chimneys in the Front or double-Building require to be rai'sd in the middle of the Houſe, and not on the ſide-Walls; as for the ſide-Building or Wings of the Houſe, it not being a double-Building of ſuch Bulk, the Chimneys may be plac'd in another figure: All which Chimneys ſhould have their Tunnels, not in the common form, but in the ſhape of Flower-Pots, Vines, Cenſers, Candleſticks, or ſome ſuch Fancy; yet ſo as all to be of one kind, as the Architect ſhall think fit; all which would be much more Graceful and Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal than the common ſhape, and altogether as Convenient, Cheap, and Uſeful: And ſo I have done with the firſt Double-ſide or Front of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Next, for the Sides or Wings, they muſt be of a lower and narrower Structure, as being the main Rooms of Uſe, and to attend upon the greater Pile. To each Side I allow One hundred and fifty Foot in length, out of which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47781:153"/>
we may take ſufficient Space for Chimneys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stairs, and Paſſages. The breadth of the lower-Rooms, beſides the Thickneſs of the Walls, to be eighteen Foot; and therefore they muſt have Thorough-Lights: And on the within and Court-ſide I would have a Cloiſter or Walk of about ten Foot broad and fourteen Foot high, the Pillars or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work whereof to meet at the top, and to have little Niches for <hi>Buſto's,</hi> or for ſome Imagery in <hi>Relievo.</hi> Over this Cloiſter I would have the upper-Stories extended; ſo that they will be of twenty eight or thirty Feet in breadth, which I thus diſtribute, <hi>viz.</hi> Eightee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Feet for the Chambers, which muſt be ſquare, their heigt eleven Feet, and Windows propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable; and on the ſide of each Chamber there will be ſufficient on the Court-ſide, or on the Hanging-over the Cloiſter, to make two little inward Rooms or Cloſets, of about ten Foot ſquare each, which may ſerve for Lodging-Rooms for Servants, attending on Gentlemen or Ladies, as alſo for Cloſets, Wardrobes, or Places of Convenience; ſo that there will be ſix larger Chambers, and twelve leſſer Chambers or Cloſets upon a Floor, and the like Number in the upper-Story, if the Architect think fit. I would not have the Vaults on the ſides to be above three Foot above Ground, for that is ſufficient to give Light to the Subterraneous Rooms or Offices, which Rooms may be ſunk to what depth we pleaſe. The Rooms on the Firſt Floor above
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47781:153"/>
Ground may be deſign'd for Ordinary Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining-Rooms for Strangers, a Room for the Gentlemen-Servants to eat in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would have two Stair-Caſes and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-Entries on each ſide, one at each cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where the ſide-Buildings or Wings are join'd to the Main Body or Grand Front; the other in the middle of the Sides, with Steps gently riſing to the Firſt Floor or Paſſage, where Stairs likewiſe are aſſign'd. I would likewiſe have the Cloiſter continu'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that ſide which makes the Main Body; but withal, there muſt be a greater Allowance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Building, <hi>viz.</hi> Nineteen or twenty Foot in height, and in breadth about thirteen, with a fair Aſcent in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, leading to the Grand Paſſage of the Houſe, and anſwerable to the Entrance on the Front. Over this Cloiſter Walk there is to be no Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but a flat, leaded Walk, like a Terras, where may be placed Statues, with Boxes of Orange-Trees, Lemons, Jeſſamins, Flower-Pots, and Greens, with ſome Bird-Cages, to be convey'd or remov'd, as Occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; as likewiſe two Fountains or <hi>Jetteans,</hi> with their Baſons, the Water to be deliver'd by Pipes into the Baſe-Court, to furniſh other Fountains or Baſons; all which would not only delight the Eye but the Smell too, at ſuch Time as the Balcony-Windows of the middle-Gallery; before ſpoken of, ſhall be opened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:47781:154"/>
The other Wing, which makes up the third Side of the Houſe, I would have to be the ſame in Form and Dimenſions with that I have now deſcrib'd; ſaving, that at the farther ends of theſe Sides or Wings of the Houſe, I would have an Armoury in one, and an Jirfirmacy in the other. And as for the Garrets or Roof-Rooms of the whole Houſe, they are to be for the Uſe of the Domeſticks, or Apartments for Women; as alſo for the Pages and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, which are Retainers to the Family, with convenient Places alſo for the Occaſions of the Landery.</p>
            <p>As for the Inward-Court of this Building, I would have it neatly Pav'd or Pitch'd, and not to be of Earth, with Gravell'd Walks and Graſs-Plats; for theſe in the Winter-time will looſen after a Froſt, and ſtick to the Feet; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Waſhings of Rain will fill the lower Draughts with Filth: Nor is there any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of too much Heat to be reflected from the Stones, as my Lord <hi>Verulan</hi> does object; for the ſides of the Houſe will guard the Courts ſufficiently from ſuch Annoyance: But this, as many other things, muſt be left to the Fancy of the Builder. However, I ſhould like two Fountains, or <hi>Jetteauz,</hi> with their Baſons, in the midſt of the Court, on each ſide one; and the further end of the Court, or fourth Side, anſwering the double-Building, to be all of Grate-work, with Freeſtone-Pillars, and Statues on the tops, giving a View or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect into the Grand Garden, the Doors or
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:47781:154"/>
Gates being of Azure and Gilded, opening in the middle, and giving Entrance thereinto.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Buildings, of which I have already ſpoken, on the back-ſides of the two Wings ſhould be Stairs leading down into the Offices and Cellers, as alſo at twenty Paces diſtance a long range of low Buildings, in form of a Penthouſe, not exceeding the heighth of an ordinary Wall of fourteen Foot. The Uſe of theſe is for Store-Houſes for Coal and Wood, for feeding of Poultry, for waſhing of Linnen; as alſo for Lodging-Rooms for the Inferior Domeſticks, as Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners, Cooks, Scullions, Common Footmen, and the like. I allow twenty Paces breadth to the Walk before the low Buildings, for the Convenience of Carts and Drays to come and go on the Back-ſide, to bring all neceſſary Proviſions, of what kind ſoever. Likewiſe I would have the Current of Water running from the Roof, not to be diſcharg'd by Pipes on the Court-ſides but to be let round by a kind of Gutter upon the Leads to the Back-ſides, there to be receiv'd into great Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns of Lead, for the Occaſions of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, and from thence to be conveyed into the Common Draught or Vaulted-Shore, or to ſerve the Occaſions of the Kitchen-Gardens.</p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice for the Draught of the Main Building, with one further Remark only, that in caſe the Building be of Stone, the inſide Walls muſt be lin'd with Brick to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Injuries which may happen to the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:47781:155"/>
Rooms and Furniture, from the dampneſs and ſweating of the Stones. The next thing to be conſider'd of is the Gardens, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Kitchen, and that of Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the Pleaſure-Garden, into which, as I ſaid before, we are to make our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance through the ſide of Grate-Work, which makes up the Quadrangle of the inner Court: The Par-terries or Plan of the Ground to be allow'd for the Garden, ought at leaſt to be Six-Score Paces or Yards in breadth, and Nine Score in length; which I divide into three equal Parteries or Gardens, allowing to each Garden one hundred and twenty Paces, and ſixty for depth, the Garden equally extending it ſelf on both ſides the Houſe. As to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Firſt Garden, let it be ſubdivided into Two Plats or Plans by a grand Alley in the middle, of thirty Foot in breadth; the ſide or round about Alleys to be fifteen in breadth, the borders on the ſides of the Alleys ſix foot breadth, as alſo three foot along the Walls or Sides of the Garden where Fruit-Trees may be planted. Within which Borders on the ſides, let there be other leſſer Gravell'd Alleys of about ſix foot breadth with paths through the middle of the Borders, of a juſt breadth, to paſs from Alley to Alley. When this is done there will remain a Quadrangular Plat in the middle, which may ſerve for a Graſs-Plat, and in the midſt thereof let there be a fair Fountain with a Baſon of thirty foot Diameter, well pav'd and flank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d with Free-Stone, and in the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:47781:155"/>
Centre of this let there be ſome Statue deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Water into the Fountain, ſuch as <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> riding upon a <hi>Tritan,</hi> out of whoſe Shell let the Water ſpout, or a Sea-Monſter thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Head, and ſpouting out the Water into the Air, or a <hi>Diana</hi> with her Nymphs ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing themſelves, and the Water trickling down the Linnen wherewith ſhe drys her ſelf; Or ſome other naked Female Figure, with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter letting out at her Nipples, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch Inventions. The like Curioſities of Walks, Fountains, Statues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be in the other Partern or Partition of this Firſt Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p>The Borders which may be made, more or fewer, wider or narrower, according to the Genius of the Gardner, I would have reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Flowers, for every Month or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year: For to ſee a Flower-Garden without its decorations, is all one as to ſit down to a Table furniſht with Cloth, Plates and Napkin, and nothing ſerv'd in. To enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the particular Flowers would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, the Curious may find Varieties to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain themſelves in Mr. <hi>Wooldrige</hi>'s <hi>Collection,</hi> and eſpecially Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi>'s <hi>Kalendar,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has oblig'd all lovers of planting, by his Excellent Books upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>All throughout the Borders at an equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, let there be little Buſhes of Ever-Greens, as Dwarſt, Cypreſſes, Philyreas, Roſemary, Lavender, Bays, Lawns, Limes, Savine and Rue; for theſe alſo are Green in Winter and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47781:156"/>
Sticky. Alſo ſome kinds of Holly would be Ornamental, as likewiſe little Firr-Trees, but theſe muſt be remov'd every three Years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be dreſt without ſpoiling their Figure; let there be planted likewiſe up and down ſome little Tufts or Matts of Peaks for theſe look prettily in the Winter, as alſo ſome Mizerean Trees and the like.</p>
            <p>Along the Grand Alley, as alſo from the ends of the long Upper-Walks, we may have three Aſcents to Mount by, into the Second Garden, each Aſcent to conſiſt of ſixteen or ſeventeen Steps, which ſecond Garden I would have to ſtand nine foot above the firſt, which may eaſily be brought about, the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign both of the Houſe and Garden being on a Riſing Ground, as I ſaid at the beginning; ſo that the Second Garden will be as a Terras to the firſt; and in the ſides of the Bank which parts the two Gardens, and looking full to the Sun, we have a place for our Green-Houſes. Theſe Green-Houſes muſt be at the leaſt nine foot high; for otherwiſe they will not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of holding Caſes or Boxes of Orange-Trees of any conſiderable bigneſs. Theſe Green-Houſes likewiſe ought to be ſunk three or four foot under Ground, for by this means the Plants will be better defended from the Froſt. Alſo the Vaults ſhould be made of Brick to keep out the dampneſs of the Earth, and I like Matted Doors or Pent-houſes to be hoiſt up and down at pleaſure, much better than Glaſs-Doors, tho they are not ſo beautiful: For
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47781:156"/>
they will defend the Caſes very well from Cold; or perhaps it may not be inconvenient to have the Glaſs-Doors lin'd with a thick Matting within, or to be cover'd therewith on the our-ſide, as ſhall be moſt convenient. The Furniture of the Green-Houſes ought to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> Orange and Lemon-Trees, Myrtles, of which the ſmall leav'd Myrtle is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be preſerv'd: <hi>Tuberoſus</hi>'s, which will hold their Flowers in Winter, <hi>Jeſſamins</hi> of all ſorts, as the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> or <hi>Jeſſamine</hi> of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the <hi>double-bloſſom'd Jeſſamine,</hi> with a Flower like to a Double Cherry, the <hi>Perſian Jeſſamine,</hi> and the like; as likewiſe <hi>Mavyn, Syriacum,</hi> which tho a little Shrub, or a ſort of <hi>Maſtick Thyme,</hi> is much to be valued for its rich, Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Smell: the Olive-Tree, the Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-Tree, the Oleander or Roſe-Lawrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewiſe in the ſame Bank let there be Variety of Seats, and in the midſt a <hi>Grotto</hi> made of Shell-work, with ſome little Imagery, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Water through little Pipes, with ſome wetting-Places, as alſo a Bathing-Place or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the midſt; likewiſe ſome artificial Birds murmuring or chirping, a Serpent hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, with ſome contiguous Furies, would very much contribute to the pleaſure of ſuch <hi>Grotto</hi>'s. All which Water-works, whether of <hi>Grotto's</hi> or <hi>Fountains</hi> are to be fram'd with proportionable Pipes for the clearer Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Water to ſome of the lower Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and from them to the Offices of the Houſe. On the Tops of the Degrees or Stairs
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47781:157"/>
by which we aſcend to the Second Garden, let there be erected little Pyramids with gilded Balls, or little Angels on the tops of them.</p>
            <p>The Second Garden being of the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions with the firſt, I would have diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ſame Order of Walks, Alleys, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Graſs-Plots and Fountains; only for Variety let the Graſs-Plots and Alleys about them be of an Oval Figure: Alſo let the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be planted with Flowers of different kinds from thoſe of the lower Garden, yet ſerving the ſeveral Months or Seaſons, which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be done, if we except the Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which admits but of little Variety: And as the firſt were adorn'd with Ever-Greens, ſo let the Borders of this be adorn'd with dwarft Fruit-Trees, as Cherries, Apples, ſome choice Pears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cut and ſhap'd into little round hollow Buſhes: likewiſe to have little Lath-Walkes for Climbers or Honey-ſuckles, <hi>Indian Cieſtes,</hi> and the like. On the ſides of this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den I would have Two Terras-Walks, over-looking the Country on either ſide, each Walk being ſixty Paces long. From this Second Garden let there be three Aſcents (as from the former) landing into the third and laſt Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Alſo about the VValls of the Terras of this ſecond or Middle-Garden, let there be planted ſome ſorts of Fruit-Trees, and here and there ſome Common Jeſſamines, the White and the Yellow. Trial likewiſe may be made of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſſamine, and of the broad-leav'd Myrrh, as we ſee in the <hi>Tuilleries</hi> at
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:47781:157"/>
               <hi>Paris,</hi> but I fear they will not reſiſt the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Climate, tho they be fenc'd with Mattings.</p>
            <p>The Third or laſt Region of our Pleaſure-Garden I would have wholly to be deſign'd for Boſcage: Only Three long Alleys run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the farther end by way of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe which traverſe to the lower Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. Let there be likewiſe up and down little private Alleys or Walks of Beech, for this is a delicate Green: Here likewiſe let there be Tufts of Cypreſs-Trees, planted in the Form of a Theater, with a Fountain at the bottom, and Statues round about; likewiſe Fir-Trees in ſome negligent Order, as alſo Lawrels, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrea's, Bays, Tumariſt, the Silac Tree, <hi>Althea</hi> Fruits, Pyracanthe, Yew, Juniper, Holly, Cork Tree, and in a word, with all ſorts of Winter Greens which may be made to grow, together with wild Vines, Bean-Trefoile, <hi>Spaniſh Aſh,</hi> Horſe-Cheſnut, Sweet-Brier, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Suckles, Roſes, Almond-Trees, Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo up and down let there be little Banks or Hillocks, planted with wild Thyme, Violets, Primroſes, Cowſlips Daffadille, Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Valley, Blew-Bottles, Daiſies, with all kinds of Flowers which grow wild in the Fields and Woods; as alſo amongſt the Shades Strawberries, and up and down the Green-Walks let there be good ſtore of Camom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le, Water-Mint, Organy, and the like; for theſe being trod upon, yield a pleaſant Smell; and let the Walls be planted with Hedera, Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:47781:158"/>
and Philyrea's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that this Third Garden, Grove or Wilderneſs, ſhould be made to repreſent a perpetual Spring; To which end and purpoſe let there be large Aviaries in convenient places, which ſhould have Ever-Green Trees growing in them, eſpecially ſuch as bear Berries, together with little Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for Freſh Water. Likewiſe for Variety's ſake, let there be here and there a Fruit-Tree, as Plumbs and Cherries, Haw-Thorn, with ſuch like as will not run to Timber; for theſe Trees alſo have their Beauties in their ſeveral Seaſons. In a word, let this Third Region or Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be Natural-Artificial; that is, let all things be diſpos'd with that cunning, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us into a belief of a real Wilderneſs or Thicket, and yet to be furniſhed with all the Varieties of Nature: And at the upper end of this Wilderneſs, let there be a Grate-Gate, anſwering the Entrance to the Garden; beyond which, and without the Territory of our Garden, let there be planted VValks of Trees to adorn the Landskip; Likewiſe a Bowling-Green and Poddock would be ſuitable to this higher Ground; and thus at length the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect may terminate on Mountains, VVoods, or ſuch Views as the Scituation will admit of.</p>
            <p>Our Kitchen-Gardens are the next thing to be ſpoken to, and theſe muſt be double, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Two Grand Apartments of the Houſe, and are to have their place im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately behind that Range of low Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47781:158"/>
or Offices which run along the two wings of the Main Structure. The breadth of theſe Gardens I would have to be equal to the length of theſe Sides, as alſo of the Court-Walls, which make the Entrance to the Houſe, and ſo down to the Stables, of all which by and by; ſo that the breadth of each Kitchen-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den will be at leaſt One hundred and twenty Paces; and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> depth, more or leſs, as it ſhall ſeem good, there being Out-let enough and to ſpare out of the Space or Ground we at firſt allow'd, which was half a Mile every way for the Buildings and their Appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>I would have the Kitchen-Garden likewiſe to be divided into ſeveral Apartments, not as the Pleaſure-Garden, by Aſcents and different Ornaments, but by ranging or diſtributing the Herbs, which may ſerve the Occaſions of the Kitchen, according to their ſeveral Uſes: Odoriferous Herbs, with ſuch as are fit for the Pot, or the Diſtillatory, ſhould be in one quarter, as Thyme of all ſorts, Winter-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, Marjorum of all ſorts. Sorrels, Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſs, or <hi>Langue-de<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Beuf,</hi> Borrage, Orach, Bloodwort, Cumfry, Spinage, Leeks, Onions, Garlick, Parſley, Violets, Hyſſop, Staechas, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy, Sweed-Moudlin, Southern-wood, Fennel, Baum, Angelico, Lavender, Organy, or Penny-royal, Beets of all ſorts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Another Quarter of the Garden ſhould be for Roots; as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot, Scorronera, Radiſhes, Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luccio, Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſh, Parſnips, Skirrets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as for Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47781:159"/>
Potato's, Jeruſalem-Artichokes, and the like, they are a wild ſort of Fare, and may do well enough in Common Ground: And as for Beans, Peaſe, Worts, Cabbages, and the like, they will require more room than what we can allow them in this Place.</p>
            <p>The Third Quarter of the Kitchen-Garden I would have aſſign'd for Sallad-Herbs; as Lettices of all ſorts, Chervil, Burnet, Chivet, Endive, Spinage, Aliſanders, Sweet-Baſil, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, Rocket, Cellery, Sage, Corn-Salad, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, Cucumbers, Garden-Creſs, Indian-Creſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not forgetting ſuch things as ſerve for Seaſoning of Diſhes, and our Ragouſts, as Garlick, Roccombol, Eſchalot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Quarter of our Garden, let it be for Aſparagus, Cole-Flowers, Brocoli, Dutch-Savoys, Muskmelons, Artichoaks, Kidney-Beans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and up and down the Beds let there be planted ſuch common Flowers as may ſerve for Garniture or Shew; as Columbines, Star-wort, Flos-Solis, Holy-oaks, common Carnations, Pinks, Lilies, Gilliflowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As likewiſe let there be Proviſion made in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Quarter for Phyſick-Herbs: And likewiſe in the Kitchen-Garden, or near it, let there be a large Recepticle of Water; in or near which let there be a quantity of rotten Horſe-Dung, or Pigeons-Dung, to ſoak, which, after it has been heated by the Sun for ſome time, may ſerve the Occaſions of the Garden. Likewiſe, let there be Stores or Magazines to all the Gardens, or a Compoſt of rotten Dung,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47781:159"/>
whether of Horſe or Sheep, with Lime di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreetly us'd, ſome Aſhes, the Earth of rottin Wood, the Duſt or Powder of old Wythies, and the like; which, after it has been well temper'd together, and thoroughly digeſted, (which will not be under a Year or two,) it will be ſtill at hand to ſerve the Seed-Plots, and other Occaſions of the Garden: And this ſort of Compoſt will not be very apt to breed Weeds, eſpecially if the Pots or Seed-Plots be powder'd with the Earth in the hollow of an old Tree finely ſifted.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in ſome convenient Place without the Kitchen-Garden, there ought to be ſome Proviſion made for Cherry-Trees, Plum-Trees, Filbrids, Walnuts, Quinces, Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with the like; as alſo for Gooſe-berries, Ras-berries, Currans, Straw-berries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Walls of all the Kitchen-Garden to be planted with Vines, and all ſorts of Wall-Fruit. There muſt be likewiſe a Plantation or Nurſery. All which, with many other things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are to be left to the Care and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Gardeners, who ought to have their Lodges near the Walls, and over-looking the ſeveral Gardens, with Poſtern or Privy-Doors into them, and good Maſtiff-Bitches to guard them.</p>
            <p>As for Vineyards, I account them a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Curioſitv; for they will never come to much, unleſs it be in a Soil, or Riſing-Ground, near ſome great River, where the Beams of the Sun reflecting from the ſmooth
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47781:160"/>
Surface of the Water againſt the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Banks, may contribute ſomething poſſibly, eſpecially in a hot Seaſon, to the Maturation of the Grapes. Beſides, that in the Model I here propoſe, there is Wall-room ſufficient to make a conſiderable quantity of Wine. There is one thing farther to be regarded in the Pleaſure-Garden, which is, to have Seats within the Walls on every ſide, in the nature of Vaults or Summer-Houſes, finely paved, with Arch-work, and ſome little riſe by Steps; by which means ſuch as walk may eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and enjoy either the Sun or the Shade, and be ſecur'd from the Annoyance of Winds and Rains, at all Seaſons of the Day and of the Year. And thus much may ſuffice for a rude Draught of the Gardens.</p>
            <p>We are now in the laſt place to conſider of other Buildings, as Stables, Coach-Houſes, as alſo of the Courts or Approaches to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Houſe. The Courts then leading to the Front ought to be two at leaſt; the Figure or Form of them, whether ſquare or oval, may be left to Fancy. The Firſt or Outward-Court of Approach ought to be eighty Paces in the ſides at leaſt, with proportionable Gates of Grate-work, Walks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Walls to be planted with Philirea's, and at the Entrance two ſtately Pyramids of forty Foot high at leaſt, with Angels or gilded Balls on the top, and within the Gate a convenient Lodge for the Porter, in the midſt of the Graſs-Plots Statues. The ſecond Court would require to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47781:160"/>
be of the ſame wideneſs, but not of the ſame depth, but rather ſomething leſs than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and to be aſcended by Steps or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; at the Entrance, the Arms and Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Family, with their Supporters, or ſome Figures of Gigantick Form. In the midſt of the Parterrees on either hand, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, if there be ſufficient Store of Water, with Cypreſs-Trees round the Borders. Through this Court we are to aſcend by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or Stairs into the Dwelling-Houſe; but the Form and Figure of ſuch Stairs is to be left to the Architect. On the ſides of the Inner-Court a Terras would be very proper, and the Walls on the Top or Creſt may be adorn'd with Flower-Pots, little Pyramids, Anticks, and the like.</p>
            <p>Next, for the Stables they are to be two, anſwerable to the two Apartments of the Houſe, and they are to be plac'd at about twenty Paces diſtance from the ends of the firſt Court Walls, that there may be ſufficient room for Teams to go to the back-ſides of the Apartments, to ſerve the Occaſions of the Houſe, as I have before-mention'd; which Entrance ſhould be of Paliſade-work. Each Stable ought to contain Sixty Hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es at leaſt, beſides Coach-Houſes; over which to be Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the Grooms, Coach-men, and ſuch Foot-men, and other Servants as are appointed to attend them. Each Stable therefore will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to have a hundred Paces, if ſingle; for as for double Stables, they are not graceful,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:47781:161"/>
nor can there be ſufficient room within for Provender, Harneſs, and other Furniture. I would likewiſe have ſome Water diſcharging it ſelf into the Ciſterns, at the Entrances into the Stables, as alſo within the Stables, for many Uſes, in order to keep them neat: For the Stables to be built in a long, ſtrait line, is not ſo graceful; let each Stable then conſiſt of two Circles, in form of a <hi>Greek</hi> Gamma <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
               </gap>, thus: For in this Poſition or Figure they will look like two Piles or grand Wings of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building, incloſing the Approach to the Houſe with great State: So that the two Stables ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themſelves in Front on either ſide the Dwelling-Houſe, the whole Front of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> Stables, Dwelling-Houſe, with their interjacent Paſſages, will be about Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Paces wide; which interja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Paſſages betwixt the Stables and the Firſt or Outward-Court Walls, require, I ſay, to be Paliſade-work; as likewiſe a long Pale or Rail-work of the ſame Figure and Shape, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning acroſs from the end of one Stable to the end of the other, with double Gates in the middle, oppoſite to the Entrances of the Court, would be very convenient and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>It will be convenient likewiſe for the Houſe, as alſo for Strangers, if there be a pretty neat Inn built at a little diſtance from the end of one Stable, and this for the Accommodation of ſuch as have recourſe to my Lord; and at the like diſtance from the end of the other
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:47781:161"/>
Stable, a fair Dog-Kennel, with its Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Lodings for the Keeper and Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Below each Stable let there be a fair Fiſh-Pond, for watering the Horſes when they are breath'd about the Lawns; which Ponds ſhould be grac'd with Swans and other Fowl, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundantly ſupplied with the Waters run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning continually from the Fountains of the Gardens and higher Grounds, will be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fat from the Common Draughts and Swill of the Houſe. I could wiſh, I confeſs, much more Fountain-Ornaments than what I ſpeak of in this Deſign; but when I conſider the Nature of our Climate, we cannot be ſo liberal this way as would otherwiſe be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Beauty of a Noble Seat: For the Froſts are long, and our Soil generally moiſt and weeping in the Winter; ſo that the Pipes will be oftentimes in diſorder, and to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ground perhaps under the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Building, would be a thing of great Expence, Trouble, and Hazard; tho' it muſt be ſaid too, that we having Lead in good ſtore, ſuch Expences will be leſs chargeable. Many Fountains likewiſe in a Garden, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in our cold Region, will chill the Ground, and be a Hindrance to the Growth of choicer Plants, if the Water be not very carefully conveighed under Ground by Pipes accurately ſoldred, and of a juſt Diame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er: Tho' ſo few as are here deſign'd, may, without diſpute, be us'd and preſerv'd without any conſiderable Damage or Hazard, eſpecially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47781:162"/>
the declining Poſture of the Ground in all the Gardens and Courts; by which means the Current will be very Natural, and one Fountain feed or ſupply another.</p>
            <p>From the Dwelling-Houſe let us, in the next place, take a Walk along the Grand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue to the Gate or Entrance of the Park, of which I ſpake at the beginning; where muſt be a Grange or Farm, with other Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for the Uſe and Service of our Country Manſion: For it cannot be imagin'd that the Port and Expences of a Nobleman's Family can be ſupplied by the Clouds, tho' they drop never ſo much Fatneſs. And the many Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Labourers depending upon ſuch a Structure, muſt of neceſſity require ſome ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proviſion to be made for them alſo. This Deſign or Building therefore which I mention in the laſt place, ought to be perfected in the Firſt; foraſmuch as before we build a Houſe we ought to have a Place of Accommodation for the Workmen and Labourers who are to build it: And before any ſuch Project be thought upon, the Undertaker ought to be provided with a Country which does abound with good ſtore of Timber, as alſo with Stone, Lime, Ground fit to make Brick, and above all, as I ſaid at the beginning, to be near a Navigable River; for without theſe Circumſtances, ſo great a Deſign will fall to the Ground before it be brought above Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:47781:162"/>
At the Entrance of the Park therefore I would have a little Town or Village, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about thirty or forty Houſes, built or rang'd in one ſtreight Street, leading to the Park-Gate; the Building to be low, uniform, and ſuitable for ſuch as may inhabite them, as Carpenters, Maſons, Plaiſterers, a Glaſier and Plummer, Smiths, as Lock-ſmith, Gun-ſmith, and for Tools and Implements of Husbandry, a Wheelwright, Sadler, Taylor, Shooe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Mercer or Chandler, a Butcher; in a word, for all ſorts of Artificers and Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, which any Nobleman's Houſe can ſtand in need of. Some perhaps may think it to be more expedient to have ſuch Artificers inroll'd in the Number of the Domeſticks, or thoſe who unite in Liveries. I grant indeed there ought to be an Imployment for every Fellow who attends upon a Nobleman, beſides that of eating and drinking, and waiting upon his Lord now and then at the tail of a Coach: For there is no greater Bane to a Nobleman than to have a Troop of unprofitable, idle Lobcocks, or Rogues always at his Heels; for ſuch being never inur'd to Labour, or Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when once they are purg'd out of the Family, betake themſelves to Gaming, Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe keeping, ſharking, or padding upon the Road, or perhaps have the Honour to be knock'd on the Head in Soldiers Coats. Such Servants as theſe were the Dogs who devour'd <hi>Actaeon:</hi> Let them be imploy'd therefore in the Gardens, in the Kitchens, Stables,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47781:163"/>
and about the Game: For as for Artificers, if they be not in a ſettled Eſtate, ſuch as that of Marriage, or of Houſe-keepers, they will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every turn be taking a rambling Frisk, and leave their Lord in the lurch. The beſt way therefore is to ſettle them in a Village, as I have deſcrib'd, where they may have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Subſiſtence with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and be always at hand to ſerve their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's Occaſions, and to confer with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the common Concerns of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily they depend on, living in a provident, induſtrious and reputable manner; and to this End I would not by any means have an Inn or Ale-houſe in any ſuch our Village; for this will ſoon tempt them to Idleneſs and Waſt: And if they were once in two Years to be rigg'd out in a Livery, 'twould add Splendour to their Lord, and be an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them to ſtick to his Service.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the Street I am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, I would have two other Buildings on either ſide, running out in form of a Croſs, <hi>viz.</hi> a Grauge or Farm on the one ſide, and on the other an Hoſpital, with a neat Church or Chapel, that ſo my Lord might remember, as he receives Bleſſings on the one hand, it is his Duty to repay ſomething to God Almighty on the other.</p>
            <p>The Grange or Farm-Houſe ſhould have three ſides of building, and the fourth ſide open towards the ſtreet. I would have the Farm to Conſiſt of Six Teems and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47781:163"/>
twelve Men Servants beſides a Head Bayliff or Steward to Overſee them, and to keep an Account of all the Productions of the Farm, and how deliver'd out. In this Grange there muſt be all Conveniencies for Maultery, Dairy, Brewing and Baking: For from hence all my Nobleman's Proviſions muſt come as the Occaſions of the houſe ſhall require, for to encumber a Palace herewith would be an Intolerable Annoyance. Beſides Herds and Plowmen there muſt be a ſufficient Number of Servants likewiſe for the Dairy, for Brewing, for Baking and for other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Grange, at the leaſt eight Females, over which 'twere convenient there ſhould be an Ancient Matron of Honeſty and Experience appointed, and to Govern theſe Affairs. The whole Number of ſuch Servants then cannot be leſs then Twenty five: All the Men Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to lie two and two in one common Room, near whom the Head-Bayliff, or Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rather, ought to have a ſitting Lodging with a Room to keep his Accounts. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rooms of the Grange to be for Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Maulting Rooms and other Store-Houſes with thorough Lights: Behind the Farm-Houſe muſt lie the Stable and Out-Houſes rang'd in a Convenient Order, together with a large Dove-Houſe, and Ponds for tame Fowl, and for the occaſions of Cattle.</p>
            <p>As for Orchards or Plantations of Fruit-Trees, having ſpoken already to this point, I ſhall only hint, that if the Soil were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47781:164"/>
for it, I would have the Fruit-Trees plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in long Walks, as it is in <hi>Normandy;</hi> for this looks much more ſuitable to the Grandeur of a Noble Seat, tho' I fear ſuch Trees in our Country would not be very proſperous as being too much expos'd to the weather: However, if Fruit Trees be not planted, 'twould be very Convenient and Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to have ſuch Walks in length and Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, of Lime-Trees, Elms, Oaks, and the like: For to ſee the Campain without Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture would look a little too bald, and to have it choakt up with little Encloſures would look too Yeoman-like, and would be a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to Recreations of the Field, as Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hunting, and be ſtoppage alſo to the wholſome Air, and to the Proſpect of the remoter Countrys.</p>
            <p>There muſt likewiſe be ſtore of Fiſh-Ponds: For there will be ſufficient Water for theſe, running daily from the Gardens and Offices of the Palace and the Ground about it. The Fiſh-Ponds muſt be deſign'd one below another, ſome for ſtews, ſome for feeding, and ſome for ſpawning. The Spawning-Pools muſt be but little, and every Three years New ones to be made in another place: For in a little piece of Ground freſhly broke up, Fiſh will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply prodigiouſly for the Firſt year, the next year leſs, and in the third year the Spawning-Pool will be good for little, the ſtrength and Nutritive Virtue of the freſh Earth being ſpent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:47781:164"/>
Amongſt our Pools, I would have one if poſſible for Pikes; for 'tis an excellent Fiſh, tho' deſtructive of the other Fry, nor apt to thrive in a Pond unleſs fed with a good Current. Carps, Tench, Perch, Roch and Gudgeons ſhould be the main Stock of our Pools; and one Caution ought to be given <hi>viz.</hi> Never to break the Ice in caſe of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Froſt, which Thing indeed is Contrary to the Common Practice: For I found by Experience, that in the year 1683 (one of the ſevereſt for Froſt we have ever known in <hi>England)</hi> that all my Fiſh died in thoſe Ponds where I brake the Ice, only in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pool or Pit which I took no care of, believing it to be frozen to the Bottom, there the Fiſh all eſcap'd and grew Extraordinary: The Reaſon for their Growth was the ſame with that for there Preſervation: For as I conceive, there are many nitrous particles or kinds of ſpirits iſſuing continually through the Body of the Earth, from which nitrous Exhalations or Atoms all Things derive a ſeminal virtue, and have there accretion; ſo that the Rigorous Seaſon ſealing up all the Exteriour Paſſages and Pores of the Earth, and covering the Water too with a thick coat of Ice, impenetrable by the Air, and through which ſuch Exhalations cannot paſs, the Fiſh by this means receive much more Nouriſhment than at other Times, the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and Sides of the Pool which lie under the Ice being free to admit of ſuch perſpir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:47781:165"/>
which cannot fly out into the open Air as at other times, by reaſon of the congeal'd Surface of the Water; and this is the true Reaſon of <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s Obſervation of ſome ſorts of Fiſh that they were <hi>longo frigore pingues;</hi> and upon the ſame Account it is likewiſe that Fiſh are found in the Northern Seas in much greater Numbers and of a larger Bulk than in the Southern. And truly I can averr it upon my own Experience, that after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Winter before-mention'd, when the Ice was thaw'd, I took out of my Pools Carps big with Spawn ſome 14 ſome 16 Inches long, which the Summer before were not above 4 or 5 Inches in length; ſo that they grew 10 or 11 Inches, or better, in Eight Months ſpace, which could proceed from nothing but the Extremity of the Cold. The Reaſon why Fiſh turn up their Bellies and die upon the breaking of a Pool, is this: When a hole is made in the Ice, the compreſs'd Water flows out thereat in a full Stream or Guſh: This Motion of the Water upon the Inlet of freſh Air draws the Fiſh to the breach from out of there Banks or Holds where they lay warm, tho much incommoded for want of Air, which the cloſeneſs of the ſurface would not allow them: Coming therefore to the broken places for Reſpiration, the exceſſive coldneſs of the Air preſently be numming them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of ſenſe and afterwards of life: This they who pretend to ſtealing of Fiſh underſtand too well, and the leſs the hole
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:47781:165"/>
is, ſo a man can but turn and wind his hand in it, the greater will be the crowd of Fiſh about it, and conſequently they will fall more eaſily within the Clutches of ſuch Fiſh-Mongers. There's no Expedient therefore better than not to break the Ice at all in caſe of an extraordinary Froſt. As for other Obſervations relating to a Farm, they have been breifly glanc'd upon in the foregoing Chapters.</p>
            <p>From the Grange or Farm-Houſe, let us croſs over the way towards the Church or Hoſpital: let the Hoſpital then conſiſt of two ſides, one for Maim'd or Aged Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Widowers or ſuch as were never Married: The other ſide for Women under the ſame circumſtances, whether Virgins or Widows; for married Couples will never accord with the Orders of a Publick Hoſpital. Let there be Chambers for Twelve Men and for as many Women their Cells to be on the Ground-Floor, let each Cell conſiſt of Two little Rooms with convenient Out-let and a little Garden. On each ſide of the Hoſpital let there be a little Refectory where they ſhall Eat in a Collegiate way, with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Kitchen and Cellar to each ſide like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: All to be manag'd by the care of ſome pious decay'd Gentlewoman or Matron with her Servants, which Matron or Governeſs alſo is to have convenient Lodgings and Maintenance for her Care and Labour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:47781:166"/>
At the upper Side and in the Front of this Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, but at ſome convenient diſtance from it, let there be a little Church or Chapel, competently endow'd for the maintenance of a grave and pious Divine, who may have his Lodgings at the end of the old Mens Apartment and towards the Church. 'Tis his buſineſs to read Prayers twice a day in the Church, to obſerve the Faſts and Feaſts as they are appointed in the Liturgy; as alſo to Inſtruct the Members of the Hoſpital, together with the Youth of the Village or Neighbourhood, in a vertuous way, and to preach likewiſe on <hi>Sundays.</hi> I would not have ſuch a Perſon to be incumbred with Tythes, but to be provided for by a Salary, or by the Annexing of ſome part of the Parochial Dues for his Support, by the Favour and Authority of the Biſhop, or in caſe it ſhould be an Impropriation (as generally it happens in all the Capital Mannours of great Noblemen) it would be in the Power, I may ſay it would be the Duty, of ſuch a Patron to make all ſuitable Proviſion, annexing the Parſonage to ſuch a Church.</p>
            <p>As for making ſuch a Village to be a Market Town or to have the benefit of Fairs, I do not much approve of it: Such a Deſign indeed would draw more concourſe of People, but withall 'twould make the place more noiſie and dirty, and divert the Inhabitants from attending the Service of their Soul, however it might tend to their own private Profits and Advantage: For ſo it is, that I would have all the Families of this little Village to be maintain'd by thier Labour in the Employment and Services of him to whom they do belong, who likewiſe, as ſuch Artificers or Labourers do decay in Age and Fortune, may diſpoſe of them into his Hoſpital, there to end there days in Piety and Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:47781:166"/>
Thus have I made a rough Draught or Deſign of a Country-Houſe according to the Idea in my own Mind: It is not my buſineſs to warrant this Model by all the Rules of Architecture and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Art. 'Tis ſufficient to my purpoſe that I have given a General Scheme, which, with a little Amendments or Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will ſtand together in ſome tolerable Figure, and anſwer our Expectation as to the Innocent Pleaſures and Delights which the Country can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
            <p>'Tis True, all Countrys do not afford us the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Advantages for ſuch a Seat as I have now diſcrib'd; nor indeed are there many Perſons to be found who have ſuch a largneſs of Mind and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as to undertake and finiſh a Deſign of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. However, ſome their are, who as there Fortunes lie without the ſtreighter limits of Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Care, ſo are they privileg'd from the Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of a Buſie Life, and have therefore Means and Leiſure in ſome meaſure or other to employ their Time, and to ſpend their days amidſt the Enjoyments of Retreat.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid in this kind is not to be underſtood in Juſtification of thoſe who abandon themſelves to a ſupine and ſleepy courſe of life, retiring to their Country-Houſes as to a Seraglio, where they paſs their Time in all manner of Senſuality, or Beaſtiality rather, as did <hi>Sardanapalas</hi> of old, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Copias,</hi> ſheltring their enormous Luſts from the Obſervation of the World under the Maſque of a ſequeſter'd life. No, no; ſuch Brutes have always met with their Rewards, feeding and fatning within their Stys in order only to their Slaughter: The True deſign then of ſuch Places of Pleaſure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat is to ſweeten the Fatigues both of the Body and of the Mind, and to recover us to our former Bent of Duty, which is but in ſome meaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Man to his loſt Station: For God doubtleſs

            <p>Some Men who are born to great Fortunes may not have thoſe Qualifications which may recommend them to Publick Employments, or Offices of State: They may want an Inſinuating Addreſs, Heat of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Boldneſs, or perhaps a ready and refin'd Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to underſtand Intrigues, and to turn and wind through all the Labyrinths of a Court: Or if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

who ſink every day under the weight of their Golden Chains? or if they arrive through a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Series of Honours and Succeſs to old Age, yet then how grateful muſt it be to humane Nature, overworn with Buſineſs to find a place of Repoſe! So that the ableſt Stateſmen, even in the higheſt Tide of Proſperity, are glad to recollect there Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits a little by withdrawing themſelves ever and anon from the Noiſe, Ceremonies, and Intrigues of a ſplended but fallacious Attendance, where they themſelves waſte there Days, and I may ſay Nights too in contriving to undermine Others, who at the ſame Time are no leſs vigilant to return the like Kindneſs into their own Boſoms: Whereas a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or a Gentleman in his Country-Houſe has all within his Territory at his Command, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection either to his Courteſie or Power. He wants no Pleaſure which Man can reaſonably propoſe. His Enjoyments are without Competition or Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and ſuch as advance the Health of his Body as well as the Content of his Mind: He lies out of ſight of thoſe more Expenſive Temptations to which a City-Converſation is Obnoxious, and in lieu thereof lets the Overflowings of his Eſtate ſpread it ſelf in a laudable Hoſpitality, by which he creates to himſelf a firm Intereſt in the Affections of his Country, which will be always at hand to ſecond him upon occaſion. Beſides; it looks great in a Man, and carries ſomething of a divine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſtampt upon it, to be able to frame a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Idea he has within himſelf; that is, to be able to give a durable Exiſtence to ſomething which was not before, and to adorn it with all the Graces of Symmetry and Beauty.</p>
            <p>And if he be a Man of a Contemplative Genius, the Seat of his Houſe cannot but ſuggeſt manlike Thoughts. The ſame Eminence of Ground which diſplays the Beauties of the Earth by day entertains

him with a much larger and more beautiful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Heavens by night, which may direct his deſires towards a more glorious and more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Manſion. The Variety of Flowers beautiful and fragrant, with which his Gardens are adorn'd, opening themſelves and dying one after another, muſt admoniſh him of the fading ſtate of Earthly Pleaſures, of the frailty of life, and of the ſuceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations to which he muſt give place. The conſtant Current of a Fountain or Rivolet muſt mind him of the Flux of Time which never returns, nor cauſes to run on, till it ends in Immenſity. But if he find Faſtidiouſneſs amidſt Fruition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> it happens uſually in the greateſt Pleaſures (thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Mind) he may then recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and think, That ſince ſuch Pleaſures are unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory and tranſitory, the Mind is yet capable of farther-Enjoyments more durable and ſincere, which ſince it cannot meet with amidſt earthly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virtiſements, it muſt look for a plentiful Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in another Region.</p>
            <p>Upon this Conſideration, doubtleſs, 'twas that many brave Men, eſpecially of the middle Age (ſo much Condemn'd as it was for Blindneſs and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition) did voluntarily exchange the Pomp and Grandeur of Life for the ſureſt and chaſt Delights of Retirement; and even at this day we may obſerve how the moſt rigid Orders of the Monaſtick State or Inſtitution do ſweeten all their Severities with the calm and Innocent Refreſhments of a Garden. So that the little Partitions of a Carthuſian's Cell may yield as much Pleaſure and Content to a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Mind as the Stupendious Fabricks, of the <hi>Lowre</hi> and the <hi>Eſcurial:</hi> For to ſpeak truly, when we converſe daily with Noble Structures, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration becomes leſs by Acquaintance; ſo that 'tis not their Greatneſs but their Order which does raviſh the Thought; which Beauty of Order may be

The little Wren has its pretty curious Neſt proportionable to its Body and Nature, and tho' humbly built, yet is it fram'd with as much accurateneſs, perhaps with more then that of the Eagle in the high Rocks, and on the Top of Mountains bordering on the Clouds.</p>
            <p>A little, well deſign'd Houſe, neatly kept, and feated in a good Air and a dry Soil, as likewiſe on the ſide of a Hill, with a ſhady Wood or Grove about it, and a pretty Spring or running Stream before it, may afford infinite delight to one who may carry a Generous and high born Soul under the Circumſtances of a narrow Fortune. The Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Wood, as it yields him Fuel againſt the Severities of Winter, defends him from many a cold Storm and Blaſt; ſo does it relieve him by its Shades againſt the ſcorching Sun in Summer, and is to him as a continual Aviary. The ſweet Stream running by his door ſerves not only the occaſions of life, but murmuring amongſt the Pebbles makes a grateful warbling noiſe altogether as pleaſing, tho' not ſo thundering, as that of the <hi>Girandola.</hi> The Induſtry and Working of his little Bees, their elaborate Cells, with their conſtant Intercourſe, may be as much Diverſion to him, as it may be to the greateſt Prince living to have the conſtant Viſit of Friends with their numerous Trains about the Gates of his Palace. A Perſon of ſuch an humble but advantageous Poſt is at no expence nor-labour to ſuck in the wholſome Air; it comes into his doors freely, and of its own accord. The neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Banks and Thickets yield him ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Flowers and Turfs ſuitable to the ſeveral ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year, and for the ſervice of Nature: His little Flocks of Sheep, with other ſuch like Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, requite his Care with conſtant ſupplies of Food and Raiment: All which and many other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:47781:169"/>
attend him conſtantly without charge and travel, without diſturbance and fear, without ſneek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Attendance, Flattery and Envy, being plac'd in that middle Region of Happineſs which lies above Oppreſſion and Neceſſity, and below the Menaces and Storms to which higher Fortunes are expos'd. And if an open Proſpect can yield Content, he is abundantly rewarded with the various Scenes of the under ſpacious Valley, where he beholds num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Objects, with the remoter Seats and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of others, chequer'd with light and ſhadows, anſwerable to the courſe of the Clouds and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings-out of the Sun: All which ſucceeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a conſtant Flux, cannot but ſhew him the Mutability of Fortune, or the Interchanges of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Adverſity to which the World under us is ſubject; and by this means he may reap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for future Occurrences, whilſt he enjoys the Bleſſings of his preſent Condition, and in his little Circle be as perfectly charm'd as he who is ſurrounded with the unmeaſurable Bleſſings of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fortune, and with all the Contrivances of Art.</p>

            <p>HAving entertain'd my Reader long enough at a Country-Houſe, I ſhall now invite him to take a Walk in the City: For ſo it is, that eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Things moſt innocent and pleaſant, by lying within our daily Converſation, beget in us a kind of Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Faſtidiouſneſs; ſo that to quicken our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, we muſt make our Sawces ſalt and picquent, for without ſuch helps the beſt Things would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too luſcious and fulſome; like as we ſee in Muſick, which would quickly nauſeate, were it not for ſome Diſcords here and there artificially inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, to awaken the Hearers Attention, who would ſoon be cloy'd and ſleepy with the continual Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monings of Concords. But be it what it will be, one of theſe two Things is certain; for the Noiſe and Entertainment of the City muſt either be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or diſpleaſing; if grateful, 'twill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſatisfactory to abide a while with it; if diſpleaſing our return to the Country will give us more Content then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The City then in which I purpoſe to wander a little, is the Metropolis of this Kingdom, which in many reſpects may challenge a Parity with, if not the Precedence of any City in <hi>Europe.</hi> I ſhall not make a large Diſcourſe of it, by recounting its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47781:170"/>
and Priviledges, it's Wealth, Greatneſs and Government: I ſhall only take a Tranſient View of ſuch Things as firſt occurr to the Eye of a Stranger, who muſt readily confeſs, that it is adorn'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble Advantages above any other City whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. It is built upon a riſing Ground or Bank which lifts it up above all the Injuries and Annoyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Floods and Vapours, and being on the <hi>North-ſide</hi> the River, the Sun draws all the Foggs the other way<hi>:</hi> It is form'd to the Figure of the River like a Semi-circle or Creſcent, javelling higheſt in the midſt, where it is alſo beautified with one of the proudeſt Temples of <hi>Europe,</hi> whilſt the City gently declining towards the extreams, it appears one of the goodlieſt Theatres in the Univerſe. On the <hi>North-ſide</hi> it enjoys a moſt ſerene and wholeſome Air, lying open to a moſt fragrant and fruitful Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Paſtures and Meadows always dry and fit for Walking, and repleniſhed with infinite Numbers of Cattle of all ſorts; beyond which at Three or Four Miles diſtance, lie the higher Grounds or Hills co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with <hi>Villa</hi>'s or Houſes of Pleaſure; ſo that whoſoever walks here muſt reap Health, as well as Delight.</p>
            <p>The Scituation of this City all along declining or ſhelving towards the <hi>Thames</hi> is of infinite Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, not only in reſpect of Proſpect, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for keeping the City clean and neat; ſo that all the Filth and Ordure of the Streets and Kennels have a quick diſcharge into the River, the River al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo affording a quick and eaſie Conveyance of all Things from one Place to another with little Charge and Difficu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>y, which otherwiſe would not be brought about but with great Expenſe and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>The River it ſelf in ſome reſpects is one of the nobleſt in <hi>Europe;</hi> at <hi>London</hi> it lies about threeſcore Miles from the Sea, and conſequently out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:47781:170"/>
of ſudden Surprizes from unwholeſome Foggs and Air, or of having a brackiſh and briny Water ſo much deſtructive to Health; and yet it brings up whole Fleets of greateſt Burthen, whether they be thoſe of War or Traffick, and is cover'd always with ſuch Ships laden with ineſtimable Riches from all Quarters of the World. And as the Tide does plentifully furniſh us with all Foreign Bleſſings, and with ſuch as are to be found in the Country which lies below the City, ſo the natural Stream or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the River does float down all the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Proviſions of what kind ſoever, that are of <hi>Engliſh</hi> growth. So that all manner of Bleſſings, whether of Art or Nature, whether from Home or from Abroad are ſtill flowing in upon this City both from above and below it with full Stream and Tide: Whilſt the River it ſelf is cover'd always with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Numbers of little Boats, and upon the Banks of it for many Miles upwards and downwards, there are a vaſt Number of ſtately Buildings and little Towns, being in a manner nothing but a Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Palaces, or Houſes of Pleaſure; ſo that each Village would in any other Place paſs for a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful City. All the Royal Palaces or Buildings are ſeated on the Banks of this River, amongſt which the Royal Caſtle at <hi>Windſor,</hi> is one of the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb Fabricks which can any where be ſeen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of the Beauty and Greatneſs of the Building, or its noble and lofty Scituation.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the Roads leading to this City are gravelly, ſtreight, large and level, and firm, and ſmooth at the Bottom, and yet the Fields and Meadows thereon bordering are moſt Fat and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant, a Thing we ſhall very rarely meet with: For the richeſt Countries are generally the moſt Dirty; and indeed the Country about <hi>London,</hi> were it other then what it is, 'twere impoſſible ſuch a conſtant intercourſe of Horſes and Carriages ſhould long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47781:171"/>
Upon all which Conſiderations, we may ſafely affirm, that <hi>London</hi> can ſtand no where but where it does, and that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> perhaps ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, there is no place to be found which does afford ſuch Conveniencies for a great and noble Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as <hi>London</hi> does.</p>
            <p>And truly, if we look within the City, it has many ſingular Beauties. It does not abound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with ſuch ſtately Palaces, as other Places boaſt of: But for the <hi>Burghoiſie,</hi> or the Merchant-like part of it, it is equal to the beſt. The principal Streets, eſpecially thoſe built ſince the Conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are moſt Magnificent, the Shops fair and richly furniſh'd, and the Broad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>'d Ways on each ſide guarded with <hi>Piliers</hi> or <hi>Barriers</hi> to keep off Coaches and Carriages from, incommoding the Foot-Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, are wonderful Convenient, and the walking upon the Broad Pavement is extraordinary eaſie and pleaſant. The continual Range of over-hanging <hi>Balconeys,</hi> is not only graceful and ornamental, but uſeful alſo to ſhelter thoſe who walk under them, from the Inconveniencies of the Sun and of the Moon, as they are Commodious for the Inhabitants when they would take a View of the Streets, and of whatſoever occurs that way.</p>
            <p>There is no City in the World can ſhew ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble <hi>Piazza</hi>'s, ſo large, ſo beautiful, and ſo regularly Built; it does abound with curious Walks, as that of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, thoſe of the Inns of Court, and others, beſides the many Gardens and Entertainments of the River. 'Tis beautified with many noble Structures; the ſtupendous Fabrick of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> the Pillar near the <hi>Bridge,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Bridge</hi> it ſelf, together with <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> and the <hi>Hall</hi> adjoyning, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Monuments are of that Greatneſs and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as will not eaſily be out-fac'd by Time. The Town-houſe, as alſo the ſeveral Halls or Colledges
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47781:171"/>
of the ſeveral Companies of Merchants and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, are moſt ſtately Buildings; and truly no City in the World can ſhew ſuch Cabarets or Taverns as can <hi>London:</hi> Theſe would paſs for Palaces in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, to ſuch a Degree of Pomp and Splendure is Ryot and Drinking arriv'd; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be to its Commendation or no, I dare not determine.</p>
            <p>And now having ſaid all this in Commendation of <hi>London,</hi> I ſhall add but one Word more, which in ſhort is this: That of all the Cities perhaps in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> there is not a more naſty and a more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Place. I ſhall not enlarge upon the Exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the City, nor declaim againſt the dear Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſorts of Liquor whether Foreign or Home-ſpun, together with the Exceſſive Rates of moſt Proviſions in the midſt of ſo much Plenty, by which means Cooks, Vintners, Victuallers, Ale-houſe-keepers, Coffee-Merchants, with ſuch like Irreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Traders acquire vaſt Eſtates quickly, and are treated by thoſe who frequent there Houſes with Terms of Condeſcenſion and Courteſie, upon hopes purely of being favour'd with ſomething which may not Poyſon 'em. I ſay, theſe and ſuch like Diſorders would take up too much Time to reflect upon, only I muſt, with my Readers Patience crave leave to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large a little upon one, which if redreſs'd would extreamly Contribute to the Benefit and Beauty of this City; and if continu'd, will ſtill leave it expos'd to many fatal Inconveniencies, I mean the burning of Sea-Coal.</p>
            <p>This indeed is that one great Nuiſance which ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies all the Beauties of this City, being ſuch as may be ſeen, felt, ſmelt, and taſted at ſome Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo obvious is it to all our Senſes: This is that which makes all the Entrances into this City to be ſo noiſome. The great Heaps, or Mountains rather, of Cole-Duſt, upon the leaſt puff of Wind
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47781:172"/>
(like the Sands in <hi>Arabia)</hi> invade and cover all Places; and lying (as they for the moſt part do) in or near the High-ways, upon the fall of Rain they render the Roads inſufferably black and dirty; ſo that a Man, if he would Ride a Mile or Two to take the Air, muſt be harnaſs'd <hi>Cap-a-Pied,</hi> and wade ſometimes to his Horſes Belly almoſt in this rich Balſamick Compound, and be as dirty as a Carrier, and although he came but from <hi>Hackney</hi> or <hi>High-Gate,</hi> he ſhall be dappled and beſpatter'd as if he had rod Poſt from <hi>York.</hi> And as this is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Caſe in the Winter-Time, ſo in the Summer 'tis altogether as Incommodious, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Roads being fill'd with Clouds of Coal-Duſt, and when Men think to take the ſweet Air, they Suck into their Lungs this Sulphurous ſtinking Powder, ſtrong enough to provoke Sneezing in one fall'n into an Apoplexy. From whence comes all thoſe Rheums, Coughs, and Conſumptions, which ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally afflict the Inhabitants of this Place, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as have not been accuſtomed to ſo groſs an Air.</p>
            <p>And ſuch truly is the Corroding Quality of this Smoak, that the hardeſt Things in Nature, or made by Art, cannot reſiſt it, witneſs the Bars and Caſements of Windows, the Balconeys, with all ſorts of Iron-work, which though never ſo well Oil'd and Poliſh'd, will in a few Years become Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and Mouldring with Ruſt, and muſt after a ſhort Time be renew'd to become freſh Fuel for this all-devouring Smoak. The Stones themſelves run the ſame Fate, witneſs St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Buildings in the <hi>Strand,</hi> as <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>New-Exchange, Northumberland-Houſe,</hi> with the more Ancient Buildings of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> all which are eaten away, peel'd and fley'd as I may ſay to the very Bones by this helliſh and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Flume. The vaſt Number of Coal-duſt
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47781:172"/>
Carts trotting up and down the Town, perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſcatter very liberally of their precious Cargo in the Streets, which all that walk along may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of freely and welcome, the Streets receiving the overplus; by which means they become moſt intolerable Dirty upon the leaſt ſhowre of Rain, and as much plagu'd with Duſt in dry Weather<hi>:</hi> From whence it is, that the Complexions of Men and Women too, if they do not waſh and daub, are ſoon tarniſh'd and become Sooty.</p>
            <p>'Twere endleſs to reckon up all the Miſchiefs which Houſes ſuffer hereby in their Furniture, their Plate, their Braſs and Pewter, their Glaſs, with whatſoever is ſolid and refin'd, all which are Corroded by it. A Bed of Fourſcore or one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds Price, after a dozen Years or ſo, muſt be laid aſide as ſullied by the Smoak, which in the Country might have been preſerv'd freſh, and in its Primitive Luſtre for many Ages. All ſorts of Hangings, eſpecially Tapeſtry, are in a few Years totally defil'd by it, loſing their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſtinking richly into the Bargain, as may be ſeen or ſmelt, rather in all the Hangings almoſt of Ordinary Houſes: Hence it is, that of latter Years they chooſe rather to make uſe of Wainſcot to line their Walls with, though this too is quickly found to looſe its Beauty. All Gildings, Pictures, Utenſils; in a Word, all manner of Furniture whatſoever, though never ſo great Care be us'd, do ſuffer extreamly by this Tartanous Smoak, as do alſo all Private Perſons, thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of better Faſhion, in their Apparel; ſo that Hats, Linnen, Perriwigs, Wearing-Cloaths, Silks, with all Things of this Nature preſently turn Ruſſet, and looſe their Gloſs and Beauty.</p>
            <p>Nay ſo piercing is this ſmoak, that it works it ſelf betwixt the joints of Bricks, and eats out the Mortar; ſo that what was Freſh and Beautiful
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:47781:173"/>
Twenty or Thirty years ago, now looks Black, Old and Decay'd, as appears in the Buildings about <hi>Hatt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n-Gardens,</hi> and up and down <hi>Holborn, Blooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and elſewhere. Upon this Account it is, that once in an Age or Two there muſt be Rebuilding, or continual Repairing in a manner the whole City, which muſt needs mortifie the Inhabitants, with a continual Embarris of Carts, loaden with Brick and Rubbiſh, and render the City (as we ſee it do's up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter) fit for nothing but Scavengers. And what is more to be lamented then all the reſt, the glorious Fabrick of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s now in building, ſo Stately and Beautiful as it is, will after an Age or Two, look old and diſcolour'd before 'tis finiſh'd, and may ſuffer perhaps as much dammage by the Smoak, as the former Temple did by the Fire.

Upon which account perhaps it might have been more convenient, that the Outſide of this ſumptuous Pile had been of a plainer mould.</p>
            <p>By reaſon likewiſe of this Smoak it is, that the Air of the City, eſpecially in the Winter time, is rendred very unwholſome: For in caſe there be no Wind, and eſpecially in Froſty Weather, the City is cover'd with a thick <hi>Brovillard</hi> or Cloud, which the force of the Winter-Sun is not able to ſcatter; ſo that the Inhabitants thereby ſuffer under a dead be numming Cold, being in a manner totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the warmth and comforts of the Day: To remedy which diſaſter they are forc'd to make more Fires than ordinary, ſo that the more Fire the more Smoak; and the more Smoak the more need of Fire; when yet to them who are but a Mile out of Town, the Air is ſharp, clear and healthy, and the Sun moſt comfortable and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Theſe and many other ſuch miſchievous Effects are the unavoidable Conſequences of this ſort of Fuel. The Remedy whereof can be no other than the burning of Wood and Charcoal, in the place of that Coal which is dug out of the Earth: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be practicable or no, is a matter which will require a further Examination under theſe three General Points. The Firſt is what Quantity of Wood may probably be ſufficient, to ſerve the occaſions of ſo vaſt a City? Next, whether ſuch a ſufficient Quantity may be found for this occaſion? And Laſtly, Whether the Profit and Benefit ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from this Exchange of Fuel, be greater than the Dammage we may ſuffer by a want of Sea-Coal?</p>
            <p>To underſtand what Quantity of Fuel may be ſufficient for this great City, we muſt enquire into its Bigneſs, the Number of its Inhabitants, and the Circumſtances of the Climate. As to the Bigneſs of <hi>London,</hi> 'tis without diſpute Greater by one Third, than it was before the Conflagration: For upon that General Deluge (as I may ſay) of Fire, ſo many hands were employ'd in the Repair of it, and ſuch a confluence was there likewiſe of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from all quarters of the Kingdom, and from abroad, that Men ſoon acquir'd a deep inſight and great experience, in the Art of Contriving and Building, and every Carpenter almoſt and Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer became an Undertaker. And when the Ruins were Repair'd, that they might keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Employ'd they made uſe of all Inventions whatſoever, to engage men into farther Labyrinths of Building, making ſhew every where of new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Contrivances, as alſo of Cheaper Methods. So that a Houſe now-a-days may be Built at half the Expence it would have Coſt Thirty years ago. And ſuch an Emulation was there and is there ſtill
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47781:174"/>
amongſt Men, as to the Elegancy and Convenience of Building, that what was formerly lookt upon to be very Beautiful, is now rejected as Contemptible and Antick, and fit only to be pull'd down, to make way for ſomething more Gentile and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh. And yet for all this, I am very confident that the City as to the Number of the Inhabitants, is not bigger than it was heretofore: For we may eaſily perceive many quarters of it to be very thin, by having its Inhabitants drain'd away to repleniſh the new Buildings, which yet are but very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently repleniſh'd.</p>
            <p>The Number of its Inhabitants as near as may be gueſs'd at, may amount probably to Four or Five Hundred Thouſand, comprehending therein Men, Women and Children, of which one fourth may be ſuppos'd to belong to the Country, being Commers and Goers, and drawn thither upon the account of Buſineſs or Pleaſure; which Number is ſtill greater or leſs as the Seaſons of the Year, or of Buſineſs, are more or leſs inviting. The moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way of gueſſing at its Inhabitants is from the Bills of Mortality, which one week with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother may amount to Four Hundred, or year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Twenty three Thouſand and upwards, which in the ſpace of Twenty years (the Common meaſure of an Age) may amount, I ſay, in the Summ Total, to the Number of Four or Five Hundred Thouſand.</p>
            <p>The Number of Houſes as they ſtand at preſent in the City and Precincts of <hi>London, Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Southwark,</hi> may be computed to a mount to Forty Thouſand: For as for the greater Buildings or Houſes, ſuch as the Palace Royal, the Inns of Court, of Chancery, and ſome Noblemen's Houſes, they muſt not here be reckoned as ſingle Foundations or Houſes, ſince ſome of them may contain the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47781:174"/>
of Twenty, Forty, or perhaps one Hundred private Houſes, of the middle Order, ſuch as thoſe which belong to Tradeſmen or Shop-keepers. Let the Common ſtandard therefore or meaſure of a Houſe be ſuch an one as contains Nine Chimnies, for where there is One that hath more, there are Five which have leſs: ſo that the exceſs <hi>viz.</hi> of the greater Houſes on the one hand weigh'd againſt the defect on the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Number of ſmall Buildings in private Allies and the Out-Skirts of the City, moſt of which have not above five or Six Chimnies to a Houſe, I ſay, upon ſuch an Allowance (as is here made) we may reaſonably pitch upon Nine Chimnies to be the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of every Houſe one with another; and than the Summ Total of the Chimnies may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Three Hundred and Sixty Thouſand.</p>
            <p>If we allow yearly therefore to every Chimney, one good Load of Wood or Charcoal, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, we ſhall find that <hi>London</hi> will require about Four Hundred Thouſand Loads of Wood yearly to ſupply its occaſions: And from this too we may make a conſiderable defalkment, when we ſhall conſider what a great Number there are of Brewers, Dyers, Hatters, with ſuch like Smoaky Occupations, all which require a ſtronger and more conſtant heat, ſuch as that of Sea-Coal-Fires: Which Profeſſions alſo being noyſom in themſelves and dangerous to their Neighbours, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the many Caſualties of Fire to which they are more obnoxious, it would be very ſafe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient if they were oblig'd to Settle on the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Water, which would very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Health and Security of the City: So that upon an allowance of our Furnace-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to uſe Sea-Coal, as alſo for the Sons of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> our little Forge-men and Smiths which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:47781:175"/>
to be diſpers'd up and down the Town to ſome neceſſary occaſions, we may reaſonably believe that about three Hundred and Fifty Thouſand good Loads of Wood of a Tun to each Load, will be ſufficient to anſwer the occaſions of this City.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, a Nobleman's Houſe, and where there is much of the Kitchen, will require Thirty or Forty Loads of Wood, but then we muſt Conſider, that for one Nobleman's Houſe there are Eight or Ten ſmaller Houſes of about Four or Five Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which will be ſupplied with Four or Five Loads commodiouſly; ſo that reguard being had ſtill to the proportion of the Houſe, the Quantity of Wood before mention'd will be ſufficient; and ſo much the rather, becauſe that in the Summer time moſt of the Nobility and Gentry retire into the Country.</p>
            <p>Our next Enquiry then will be, where to find ſuch a Quantity of Wood as is here pitch'd upon? To this end and purpoſe we are to conſider in the Firſt place, what quantity of Wood grows uſually upon an Acre of Ground. An Acre then of Coppice-Wood of about Twelve or Thirteen years growth, if moderately well ſtor'd, will yield about Threeſcore Cords or Loads of Wood, each Cord or Load being Eight Foot in length, Five Foot Six Inches in heigth, and Three Foot in thickneſs or length of the Billet cloſely laid together; ſo that one Acre of good Wood-Land will yield yearly about Five Loads of Wood more or leſs, and then we ſhall find, that about Sixty Thouſand Acres of Land well planted with Wood, will afford us the quantity we are now ſeeking. Theſe parts of <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> which lie betwixt <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Wells and <hi>Rye,</hi> which is about Thirty miles in length, and of a bredth proportionable, are almoſt all
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:47781:175"/>
Woods, Great part of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> of <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Barkſhire</hi> abound with vaſt Numbers of Woods: The like may be ſaid alſo of other places bordering upon the Roads of <hi>London,</hi> from all which places to <hi>London</hi> we have a moſt eaſie conveyance by Water, as well upwards by the Tide, as downwards by the Stream: For ſo it is, that the parts neareſt bordering on the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Medway</hi> are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of Wood; or if there be occaſion for a Land-carriage, ſo hard, ſo capacious and level are the Roads as are no where to be found in any other part of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What quantity of Wood this may amount to is hard to compute; but without all diſpute it far exceeds the Quantity requir'd to ſerve the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>London,</hi> eſpecially if the Iron-works, thoſe great devourers of Wood, were made to keep their due diſtance. But in regard that <hi>London</hi> is not the only mouth which is to be fed with this fiery food, there beeing ſome Conſideration to be had to the Neceſſities and Occaſions of the Neighbouring places, we muſt be allow'd more Ground than what is at this day planted with Wood, and this we ſhall not be long a ſeeking for, if we conſider of the great number of Heaths, waſte Grounds and Commons, which lie every way within Twenty or Thirty Miles of <hi>London.</hi> It may reaſonably be computed to be Fifteen or Twenty Thouſand Acres, all which at preſent is not worth Five Shillings an Acre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtock'd only with raſcally Sheep and Geeſe.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe then an Act of Parliament to be rais'd in favour of this, or ſome ſuch like Deſign, (For without the All-mightineſs of a Parliament no Great and Publick Work can ever come to any Maturity:) this Project then muſt be built upon theſe Grounds, and Firſt, In order to an Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure let all the Rights and Privileges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47781:176"/>
be brought in at ſuch a Rate or Purchaſe, as the Supreme Authority of the Nation ſhall think fit: For to deprive any one of his Right and Priviledge without due Compenſation made is very unjuſt, as doubtleſs 'tis moſt juſt ſo to do when it ſhall redound to the greater Benefit of the Public, without any detriment to the particular Perſons concern'd. Secondly, ſuch encloſed Waſtes or Commons to be carefully preſerv'd by more than ordinary Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to prevent tumultuary Invaſions of mobling Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, as likewiſe the clandeſtine Havocks to which ſuch Encloſures (eſpecially near ſo Populous a City) are very Obnoxious. To this end and purpoſe 'twould be convenient, that every Gentleman or Nobleman herein concern'd, over and above the ſubſervient Labourers to be employ'd in Planting, Fencing, Defending, Dipping, Cutting, Cording, Coating and Carrying ſuch Wood as from time to time ſhould be upon the premiſes; I ſay it would be very Expedient, that to every Thouſand Acres ſo planted, there ſhould be a Capital Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff or Ranger, whoſe buſineſs it ſhould be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to viſit the Woods under his care, and to give an Account of what may occur to his notice. Thirdly, that there be a ſtanding Court or Body of Men, deputed every three years by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City; by the Stewards of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Southwark,</hi> and ſome others alſo by Parliament, to enquire into Frauds and Diſorders; and to determine the Prizes of Wood throughout the City with its Penalties and dependencies; and in a word to Inſpect and Regulate the whole affair.</p>
            <p>And as to that particular Branch of Encloſing Commons, 'twould certainly be a thing of the greateſt Advantage that ever could be thought of, and that in reſpect of, Firſt the Commoners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:47781:176"/>
for beſides the ready Summs of Money which ſo many Families would be enrich'd with, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to their Stock and Intereſt (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would turn to a greater profit than what is reap'd from a waſte and uncultivated Common) there will be a conſtant proviſion likewiſe for a great Number of Poor Families who are now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſteal or ſtarve, having only their bare naked Paſture to feed upon, where they are expoſed all the Winter long to pinching Winds and Hunger. Every Hundred Acres ſo Planted as is here deſign'd, will very well Employ and Maintain Four Families for ever, when ſuch Woods ſhall be capable of Cutting; and in the raiſing of them, there will be continual Employment in Planting, and in making and repairing of Hedges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the poorer ſort of People will be double gainers by the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Next for the Purchaſers, 'tis as certain too, that their profit will be very Conſiderable: For the Ground which before was not worth a Noble an Acre, being Planted as 'tis here Projected, will yeild near upon Thirty Shillings an Acre for ever. And in the laſt place, the Public will reap Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by ſuch Improvements not only in reſpect of that more copious ſupply which will be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted daily to the City, but in reſpect alſo of that Proviſion which may be made for Timber, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Skirts or Outſides of ſuch Plantations: For the Government ought to have a proſpect to future Ages; and to have Timber growing ſo near to our Naval Magazines would be a Thing of Ineſtimable Advantage; the want and decay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is that, which we ſhall every day be more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of than other. Laſtly, 'tis for the Intereſt of the Common-Wealth, that Lands ſhould be improv'd in Order to make the Public Burthen
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:47781:177"/>
more eaſie: For Ground of Thirty Shillings an Acre can bear Taxes more eaſily than that of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight Shillings an Acre: And this reaſon will ever hold good, when the Dammage which ſome may receive, is inconſiderable in reſpect of the Advantage reap'd by others, and eſpecially by the Publick.</p>
            <p>What may be objected againſt this Project of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures is, firſt, That by this means there will be a greater ſhelter for Thieves, and Robbers with which ſuch Places are but too much infeſted. To this the Anſwer is eaſie, as to Robbers on the High-way, or the Bilbo-Blades, <hi>breaking upon the Wheel</hi> will be an undoubted Remedy, of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken. Pardon likewiſe, and a Reward to ſuch Robbers who ſhall diſcover their Fellows, will be a good prevention of their Confederacy, and create a Jealouſie amongſt them, or fear of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This was practis'd with very good Succeſs by <hi>Sextus Quintus,</hi> who clear'd all the Eccleſiaſtick State of <hi>Banditi</hi> or <hi>Proſcripts,</hi> by promiſing indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to every <hi>Bandit</hi> who ſhould bring the Head of his fellow: whereupon they fell to cutting of one another's Throats, each labouring to prevent his Companion from making the firſt Experiment upon himſelf; and ſo not daring to truſt one another, the Gang was ſoon broken, for ſingly they were not dangerous. As for petty Rogues, there is no great fear of them in the preſent Caſe. Mutton-Mongers would have little Employments, the Commons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unprovided with that Commodity, and for other pilfering Chapmen there will be then no more cauſe of fear than now, rather leſs; there being a full Employment for the poorer ſort, and the Overſeers of the Woods will be very uſeful alſo to obſerve the Diſorders of thoſe under their Care.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:47781:177"/>
Another Objection may be made from the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of ſo many ſmoking Cole-Pits, which we may ſuppoſe to be continually employ'd for the charboning of Wood: But for the ſame reaſon there muſt be no Lime nor Brick made: For theſe things too are of an offenſive Savour. Beſides, Charboning of Cole is a thing which will not happen above once in Twelve or Thirteen Years, ſo that the inconvenience may eaſily be born with, and is incomparably leſs than the continual ſtink of the Sea-Coal Fires, which are ſo great an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance to the Court, to the Nobility and Gentry, and in a word, to the moſt Conſiderable part of the Kingdom, whether we conſider their Number or Quality.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who follow the Chaſe might poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome prejudice as to freedom of Riding by ſuch Encloſures<hi>:</hi> But on the other hand they would reap a greater Advantage from the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Game: For ſuch Woods would ever be well furniſhed, and the Countries neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring upon <hi>London,</hi> is generally ſo open, and the Fields ſo large, that there is liberty enough for the Chaſe, without any incoveniency to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or to the Husbandman; but theſe are trivial Conſiderations, not worth our inſiſting on.</p>
            <p>Let us then haſten forwards and conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Profit and Advantage ariſing to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in general, and to <hi>London</hi> in particular, by burning of Wood, be greater than the Dammage they may ſuſtain by the diſ-uſage of Sea-Coal<hi>:</hi> If we conſider the Queſtion with an eye to the Publick, it will be told us by the Coal-Merchants, that in the Fleets where ſuch Proviſions are brought, there are a great number of Boys and Seamen bred, who are ſo uſeful to us either for War or Traffick; alſo, that one Chaldron of Coal will yield as much
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:47781:178"/>
Heat as four Loads of Wood; and that were it not for Coal the poorer ſort of <hi>London</hi> would periſh. Likewiſe, that the uſe of Coal is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Wood, and conſequently of Timber, for where great Woods are cut, many thrifty Trees, which in time would prove excellent Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are condemn'd to the Fire.</p>
            <p>As touching the breeding of Seamen by the Coal-Voyages, 'tis certain that ſome advantage doth accrue to the Nation by that means; and certain 'tis too, that would we apply our ſelves to the Fiſhing-Trade, we might be furniſht with many more Seamen than thoſe who ply betwixt <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> and <hi>London;</hi> as 'tis certain alſo, that the Fiſhing would bring us in more Profit than any other Undertaking whatſoever. But ſo it is, that we are contented to let our Neighbours Fiſh upon us (for the Net cannot well be avoided whilſt the Waters are troubled) and then make them rich at our own Expence, by buying our own Fiſh of them, at ſuch Rates as they ſhall be pleaſed to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them: Which Point would deſerve a little to be inſiſted on, were it not that the Manifold and Signal Bleſſings we have otherwiſe receiv'd of them, would lay us open to palpable Ingratitude, ſhould we once offer to conteſt it with ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, faithful and conſtant Friends, whoſe Benefits verily ought never to be forgotten. And yet, I fear, though we ſhould apply our ſelves to Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhould not be very ſucceſsful at it, unleſs we could imitate them in their Induſtry, Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and their great Care and Diligence in Curing and Ordering ſuch Fiſh: For theſe are the Three Principal Points which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to who follow this Trade; which ſuch will never be good at, who love to live in full Paſture and at Eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:47781:178"/>
But what will become of this Salt-Water Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we ſuppoſe (as really we may without much peradventure) that were Wood the Statutable and Staple Fuel of <hi>London,</hi> many Ships would be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in bringing Char-Coal by Sea from other parts of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Hampſhire, &amp;c.</hi> where ſuch Proviſion might well be ſpared. But to come to our Colliers; Be it as it will be, were <hi>London</hi> alone allow'd or oblig'd to make uſe of Wood-Fuel, there would be a vaſt utterance of Sea-Coal along the <hi>Thames,</hi> and in all the Villages adjacent to <hi>London.</hi> And whereas Commodities which come by Sea are ſubject to Diſappointments, ſo in time of War, ſhould the Coal-Fleet be taken or obſtructed, what then would become of <hi>London?</hi> But Wood being a Native of the Neighbourhood, could never fall a Prey to Pyrates, or be ſubject to Naval At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; and look what Proviſions may be made one Year, will continue the ſame in all others ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if the ſame quantity of Ground be yearly cut: For Wood is not like other Products of the Earth, as Graſs, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which by immoderate Rains, or exceſſive Heats, or by many other Accidents, may become ſcarce and dear; but look what Profit a Coppice yields at one Fillet, 'twill yield the like at another, if of the ſame Growth, and duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; ſo that our Computation being once adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, we ſhall rarely be to ſeek for new Supplies, nor be unprovided.</p>
            <p>But admitting that the <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Colliers might ſuffer ſomething by the diſuſage of their Coal in <hi>London,</hi> if it ſhall appear that the whole City, and in effect the whole Kingdom of which that City is an Abridgement, ſhall ſuffer infinitely more by the Uſe of it. I cannot ſee, what Reaſon there can be to perſwade ſo great a number of Men to a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of that which is ſo injurious to their own
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:47781:179"/>
Concerns and Intereſt, only to be thought officious and beneficial to ſome few others, who ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by get Eſtates: Juſt as reaſonable, as if I ſhould endeavour to perſwade the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> to pull up their Broad Paving with which their Streets are flank'd and which are ſo commodious to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe 'twould be for the Intereſt of Shooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers and Taylors, that Men ſhould wear out their Cloaths and Shooes by trudging up and down in the Dirt, or otherwiſe to ride in Coaches; which tho' very Expenſive to him, who goes up and down the Streets upon his Occaſions, would nevertheleſs be very commodious and profitable to Coach-makers, and to the Hackney-Merchants.</p>
            <p>That the burning of Sea-Coal may happen to be the Preſervation of Wood, is in ſome Senſe very True, but 'tis as true too; that the burning of Wood would be a greater Encreaſe of Wood, and conſequently of Timber, becauſe it would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Men to convert their barren Grounds into Wood-Plantations, whereas where Wood-Fuel is neglected or ſupplanted by that of Coals, Men are eaſily tempted to quit the Preſervation of their Woods, and convert their Ground to Tillage in hopes to find more Advantage; ſo that if Wood were made the Fuel of <hi>London,</hi> I doubt not but that many would be thereby invited to convert their Arable into Woods as a Thing of much more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: For being once Planted, they are preſerv'd with little Labour and Charge, and yield a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Revenue without hazard: For Crops of Wood with a little Care, as I ſaid before, will never fail, and being arriv'd to ſome Growth, a Year or Two's forbearance will excedingly advance the Encreaſe. And as 'tis true likewiſe, that one Chaldron of Coal will yield more heat than Three or Four Loads of Wood, ſo it is as true too, that the Dammage
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:47781:179"/>
ſuſtain'd in a Houſe in <hi>London,</hi> of any Figure o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Trade, by the ſmutty ſmoak of the Coal, is triple to the extraordinary Charge ſuch a Houſe would ly under, were it obliged only to make uſe of Wood and Char-coal.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the Poor, Sea-Coal muſt be confeſs'd to be a very commodious Fuel, becauſe cheap; ſo poſſibly might Turf and Cow-dung be; but were it not for that Thick Cloud of Sea-Coal-Smoke which covers the City in the Winter-time, and deprives it of the Benefit of the Sun, I doubt not but there would be leſs occaſion for Fire than now there is; that the Poor in <hi>London</hi> might ſubſiſt as well as they do in other Cities of <hi>England,</hi> by the Benefit only of Wood, were the Price thereof fixt to a juſt and equitable Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paris</hi> doubtleſs, is more Populous than <hi>London,</hi> and has as many Poor, the Winters likewiſe are ſharp enough, tho not ſo long as with us: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they their Wood in any Quantities grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near it, nor ſuch a River as the <hi>Thames</hi> to float it; and yet ſuch is their Oeconomy in this particular, that there is no want, nor do their Poor ſtarve in Winter. With us however, and in caſe of a Seaſon more ſevere than ordinary, 'twould be a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity becoming the Wealth and Greatneſs of ſuch a City as <hi>London,</hi> to give Four or Five Thouſand Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Sea-Coal to be diſtributed amongſt the Poorer Families, which at the Proportion of half a Chaldron to a Family, would ſupply the Indigence of Twenty or Thirty Thouſand Poor People, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable annoyance to the City.</p>
            <p>Something may be objected againſt the Uſe of Wood, as being more cumberſome than Sea-Coal, which lies cloſe in the bottom of a Cellar, and is in no danger of Fire, whereas Wood muſt have a great deal of Room to ly within Doors, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Doors too 'twill be no leſs an Incumbrance and Hazardous, tho a great Number of Houſes there are which have no Convenience without, or any ſpare Back-ſide at all, and eſpecially in the City. But this is eaſily anſwered; for firſt, It is ſuppoſed that the greateſt part of our Wood-Fuel is to be Char-coal, which will ly in as little room almoſt as Sea-Coal, in Holes and Vaults, and over and above has this advantage, that it is ſooner lighted to ſerve our Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and more eaſily, and with leſs waſte, put out, and reſerv'd for further uſe, ſo that we may kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle more or leſs of it, as we ſee good, and without waſte, whereas Sea-Coal-Fires are a long time a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and many times we are forc'd to make twice as much Fire as is needful, becauſe this kind of Fuel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made to burn in a little quantity. Wood, as Faggots, Billet, and the like, is too cumberſome for ſome Houſes, within or without Doors: It is to be ſuppos'd then, that in the out-skirts of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuch Proviſions are to be ſtor'd up, or to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready upon the Wharfs, or in Boats, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on <hi>Lambeth-ſide;</hi> from all which Places the <hi>Woodmongers</hi> may ſupply the Occaſions of private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies without great Hurry and Incumbrance, as we we ſee it done in <hi>Paris</hi> and elſewhere. And altho Char-coal of it ſelf be no very wholeſome Fuel, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in <hi>cloſe Rooms,</hi> yet being mixt with <hi>Wood</hi> which may make a Flame, it is very inoffenſive and ſweet, making a very chearful Fire, and yielding a very ſtrong and laſting heat.</p>
            <p>There remains one Objection more againſt Wood, which truly is the moſt material thing which may be ſaid againſt it, and 'tis this, <hi>London,</hi> we know, is a City very ſubject to the Misfortune of Fire, by reaſon of the great Quantity of Firr uſed in Floors, Partitions, Wainſcot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſort of Wood, by reaſon of its Roſiny Nature, is moſt apt to take
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47781:180"/>
fire, and the Hearths and Chimneys in the new Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are made ſo little, and the Wainſcot coming ſo near, there is much to be feared that way; whereas Coal-fires, lying in a Box or Grate, are not apt to fall upon the Floors, or if they do, the Cinders die preſently.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, as many Chimneys are now made, there ought to be more than ordinary care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Miſchief: However, there is hardly any Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſo little, but will contain a moderate quantity of Char-coal with ſome ſhort Billets, all which may be ſo contriv'd in Frames or Grates, as may eaſily prevent Miſchief by falling on the Floor flaming; and our Sea-Coal caſting a ſtronger Heat than other Fuel, may be every way as dangerous to thin Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot, or Boards, near the Chimneys, as Wood-fire: For ſo apt is Fire to catch, that by any intenſe heat it will kindle at a diſtance, without any ſubſtantial application of burning Matter. But whatſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience there may be upon this ſcore, 'tis no way comparable to the Advantages which will ariſe on the other hand, as is moſt evident to the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader from the foregoing Diſcourſes,</p>
            <p>For whilſt Sea-Coalis burnt in ſo great a quantity, it is at preſent, Shop-keepers muſt expect to have their Wares tarniſh'd and ſullied, which muſt needs debaſe the Price, let them do the beſt they can. The Citizens and Gentlemen muſt have their rich Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſmutted and caſted, and their cloſer Rooms ſtinking and ſmoky. Their Wearing-Apparel like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt be ſubject to the ſame Fate, and every thing muſt loſe its Luſtre. The Skins and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, eſpecially of the fairer Sex, will ſtand in conſtant need of artificial helps, which in time brings Nature under inconceivable Decays and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The Buildings, whether publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, muſt run the like Deſtiny, whilſt their Streets
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47781:181"/>
are continually dirty and ſtinking, and the Town it ſelf perpetually plagu'd with Coal-Duſt and Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh. The Inhabitants muſt be contented frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to want the Sun for many Days together, and eſpecially in a Seaſon when its Beams would be moſt welcome, as alſo to have their Bodies fill'd with Coughs and Rheums, till they fall under Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All the innocent Contents which the Mind can take from fair Proſpects, whether of Buildings, or of the Country, are loſt in theſe Clouds: All the Beauties and Verdure of Gardens, are blackened by this ſooty Air; all the Roads and Walks near the City being continually ſubject to black, ſtinking Dirt or Duſt, and from this ſtinking and ſmoaky Air it is probably, that young Infants are hardly to be bred up in <hi>London:</hi> For their new-born Bodies, like tender Plants, or Bloſſoms, are ſoon blaſted by the Sulphureous Exhalation.</p>
            <p>In a word, 'tis impoſſible for any Man to live ſweet and clean, to appear polite and well-adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amidſt ſo many inevitable inconveniencies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a vaſt Expence, which whilſt ſome of more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fortunes may bear with; Others (and they too many) of ſtraiter Circumſtances, no leſs ambitious to make a Figure in the World, according to their Birth and Quality, fall into Ruine by living beyond them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may live in the Company of thoſe of their own Degree and Rank. And it may be worth a tranſient Thought poſſibly, that as Wood-fire does totally extinguiſh (as I may ſay) all the foregoing Miſchiefs, ſo the very Aſhes of it will be a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Profit, and uſeful upon ſeveral accounts, whilſt Coal-Cinders ſerve only to choak up all the Avenues of the City; ſo that a Foreigner coming to <hi>London,</hi> would think it to be regularly fortified and flank'd with Bulwarks or Ramparts of Aſhes; or elſe fancy perhaps, theſe Mountains of Rubbiſh to be the Remains of the laſt dreadful Conſlagration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:47781:181"/>
Some little Scruple may be made againſt the Uſe of Wood-fires, from that Proviſionary Act for the Rebuilding of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, laying a Tax or Tribute on Sea-Coal for the Carrying on and Finiſhing that Great Deſign. But this is as ſoon ſolv'd as thought on: For this Project of Wood-fires, ſuppoſing it were to be put in execution, could not ſignifie any thing, under Four or five and twenty Years; for ſo long it will be before a new-planted Wood will be ſit to Fell; before which time, it may be hop'd, that Admirable Fabrick may arrive to its Conſummation, or ſuppoſing it ſhould continue longer in building, I can ſee no Reaſon why the ſame Burden or Tax may not be lay'd upon Wood for ſome ſhort time.</p>
            <p>When I firſt gave my Fancy the Liberty of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging upon this Subject, I could not imagine with my ſelf that it would have any other Effect than to amuſe the Reader, by giving him ſome Diverſion from what before he might be cloy'd with, as poſſibly by this time he is with that which I am now writing of: For it cannot be thought that an Eſſay of this nature, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from ſo mean a hand, ſhould meet with a very favourable Reception, eſpecially where the Buſineſs is of that intricate nature, as will open a Breach to divers Conteſts, and give Offence to ſome whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt lies another way; tho' peradventure it may appear agreeable to others. However, I dare be bold to ſay, that were the Matter ſeriouſly weigh'd by thoſe of Judgment and Power, as they would eaſily be inclin'd to think favourably of this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, upon Conſiderations ſuggeſted from their own Private and Prevailing Reaſons; ſo their Authority, and the Figure which they bear in the Government, would enable them to put this Project upon the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, by ſurmounting all the Difficulties which might make head againſt it: For a Buſineſs of this nature, after the Courſe of Four or five and twenty Years, (as I have already ſaid) would come to the Birth;
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47781:182"/>
as in truth all Great and Profitable Deſigns whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are the Iſſues of Time, and Things of greateſt Maturity and Duration are longeſt in their Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe we, after all, that it ſhould be found by Experience, that Sea-Coal in the preſent Caſe ſhould be more Advantageous than Wood-Fuel, and that Wood-Fuel thereupon ſhould be rejected, the Gentlemen notwithſtanding who had undertaken to plant the Waſt-Grounds and Heaths in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of <hi>London,</hi> would ſtill be great Gainers, their Ground being rendred of Thrice or Four times more Value than it was at before; which would be a good Return for their Money. Likewiſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in General would have the Advantage, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch Nurſeries for Timber, and ſo commodious for uſe. So that no Damage could accrue by the Attempt, but there would be great Certainty of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in many reſpects, tho' it ſhould fail in the Main Deſign, which in all Projects whatſoever is a very rational and ſufficient Ground for Trial.</p>
